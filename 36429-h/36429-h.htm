<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>RANDY’S SUMMER</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—RANDY AND THE FAIRY TALES</h2>
<p>
“Randy! Randy! where are you?” came
in shrill, high-pitched tones from the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
The girl on the wooden seat just outside
the door neither moved nor heeded, so engrossed
in her book was she.
</p>
<p>
“Ran-dee!” This time there was a rising
inflection on the last syllable. Slowly
the girl’s forefinger followed along the
line which she was reading. A quick step
across the kitchen, and a tall, angular
woman appeared in the doorway, wiping
her hands on her blue-checked apron.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy Weston! Here I’ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
callin’ and callin’ to you, and you’re right
here at the door and never heard at all,
I’ll warrant you. What’s that you’re
readin’?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother, I’m sorry I didn’t hear
you,” said Randy, her face still aglow
with the thought of the fascinating tale;
“but the story was so wonderful that I
never knew you called me.”
</p>
<p>
“Must have been wonderful,” said Mrs.
Weston, smiling. “What sort of a book
is it, and where did you get it?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, it’s the one I told you I found
in the field back of the barn,” said Randy.
“It’s all about kings and queens, and
princes and fairies, and goblins, and oh,
it’s just the most wonderful book you
ever saw!”
</p>
<p>
“I hope it’s a <em>good</em> book,” said Mrs.
Weston, doubtfully; “it sounds kind of
outlandish, and I know one thing, I never
have to call twice when I give you ‘Pilgrim’s
Progress’ or Fox’s ‘Book of Martyrs’
to read.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“But, mother, just see the pictures!
Here’s the one that shows when the
prince rode on the horse which was shod
with golden shoes, and could run faster
than the wind!”
</p>
<p>
That was too much for practical Mrs.
Weston.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Randy, that’ll do! That
shows what kind of a book it is. Who
ever heard of shoeing a horse with gold!
Land knows it costs enough to shoe them
with iron; and as for running faster than
the wind, why, anybody’d know better.
You give me the book till I ask your
father what he thinks of it. I’ll put it up
on the mantel, back of the clock, and show
it to him to-night and see what he says.”
</p>
<p>
As Mrs. Weston usually meant what she
said, Randy was forced to submit; but she
could not help thinking it a trial to have
to do without the wonderful book until her
father should have time to read it.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Mrs. Weston, “come in and
help me make these pies.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” said the girl; while she
thought, “What a change from the prince’s
castle to the hot kitchen and apple pies!”
However, she was a thoughtful girl, and
seeing a tired look on her mother’s face,
she took a big yellow dish on her lap, and
grasping a knife began to pare apples as if
her life depended upon it.
</p>
<p>
The first she pared rapidly and deftly,
the next one took her a little longer, and
the sixth she held in one hand while the
knife lay idly in the other, as she gazed out
of the window, wondering if the hot, sunny
road which led to the village could be at
all like the high-road over which the king’s
huntsmen returned to the castle.
</p>
<p>
“Randy Weston! I thought you was
parin’ apples! Bring the dish here and
we’ll finish them together. At that rate
you wouldn’t get them done in a month!”
</p>
<p>
Randy started. “Oh, dear! I meant to
have peeled them in no time,” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Well, never mind,” said her mother;
“we’ll do them together, and then you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
get out the things for me to make the crust
with.”
</p>
<p>
Soon the apples were pared, cored, and
sliced, and away Randy hurried to the
closet, getting the sifter, sugar-bucket and
rolling pin, the spice box, and last of all, a
lot of plates.
</p>
<p>
Running back to the closet she brought
out the lard and began to grease the plates
in furious haste, so determined was she to
show her mother that she was really willing
to be helpful. How she admired the
deft manner in which her mother rolled out
the crust, stretched it over the plate, and
inserted her knuckles to make it fit the
hollow of the dish.
</p>
<p>
Randy watched her as, balancing the
crust-covered plate on her left hand, she
swept the knife which she held in her
right swiftly around the edge of the plate,
trimming off the extra crust.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I could make pies as quick as
you can,” said the girl, “and have them
turn out right every time, too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston smiled at the compliment
so earnestly expressed.
</p>
<p>
“Mebbe you can, when you’ve made as
many as I have,” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Now get the broom, Randy, and sweep
up the flour I spilled ’round the table and
put the apple peels in the bucket, while I
commence to wash up the cookin’ dishes.”
</p>
<p>
Randy got the broom and began to sweep
vigorously. “I wonder,” thought the girl,
“if princesses have to bake pies, and wash
dishes, and sweep hot kitchens.” She could
not remember of any mention being made
of either pies or kitchens in the fairy tales
which she had been reading, so she concluded
that in those delightful days no
such things existed.
</p>
<p>
“They <em>must</em> have had pies,” she said to
herself, “so p’r’aps they had somebody to
bake for them, same’s Mrs. Hodgkins has
Sophrony Brown to help her about the
housework.
</p>
<p>
“Sophrony Brown doesn’t look ’s if she
belonged in a castle, even to stay in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
kitchen, if it had one,” thought Randy.
“Her hair’s red, and so are her hands, and
they’re awful big, too. Everybody in that
splendid book was handsome, and they all
had little white hands and tiny feet, too.”
Here she stopped and took a long survey
of her own feet, encased in coarse, cowhide
boots, with leather lacings.
</p>
<p>
“The shoes and slippers in the pictures,”
mused Randy, “have beautiful bows on the
toes, and they have tiny little heels. I
wonder how they ever managed to walk on
them.” So still she stood, looking down
at her shoes, the broom held listlessly in
her hand, that her mother turned to see
where she had gone.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy Weston, what ails you?
You’ve been mooning ’round all this morning.
You do try to help me real good, and
then, first thing I know, you’re miles away
thinkin’ of something or other. I say,
whatever ails you?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Randy, “I was only wondering
about the fairy tales in the book.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, more’n ever I think it can’t be a
good kind o’ book to read, that makes a
good, sensible girl so took up with it that
she can’t think of anything else.”
</p>
<p>
“But if father says it’s all right, I can
read it, can’t I?” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose so,” said the tired woman.
“Now go and find Prue. Like enough
she’s into something by this time.”
</p>
<p>
Little Prue had a positive talent for inventing
mischief, and as Randy hastened to
the door to call her, she remembered that
the little sister had had at least an hour
in which to play without supervision. “I
do hope,” said Randy, “that she hasn’t
torn her dress or lost her sunbonnet while
I’ve been helping mother with the cooking.
I’ll call first, and if she don’t answer, then
I’ll hunt for her.” So, standing in the
doorway, she called long and loudly.
</p>
<p>
Such a pretty picture Randy made, all
the sweeter because she never dreamed that
she possessed the beauty of which she read
in the fairy book, and for which she so
ardently longed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
The kitchen doorway was low, and up
on one side grew scarlet runners, which
over the top clasped tendrils with the morning
glories as they clambered up the other
side of the door-frame and half covered the
kitchen window.
</p>
<p>
The cool wind from across the meadow
fanned Randy’s flushed cheeks, and tossed
back some short brown ringlets from her
forehead, for Randy’s hair would curl, as
she said, “spite of anything.” She did her
best with brush and comb to make it lie
smoothly, but the short ends flew back
every time, and curled and rippled in a
manner which would have been the envy
of many a city girl who was a slave to
“curlers.” Her hair was a soft, light
brown, and her eyes were large and gray,
bright and twinkling. She was quite tall
for a girl of her age, just fifteen that summer,
and she stood as “straight as a birch,”
her father said.
</p>
<p>
Her plain calico gown and coarse apron
could not hide her trim figure; and, judging by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
small, shapely hands, and slender
fingers, one would say that with dainty
boots instead of cowhides, her feet would
be as shapely as her hands. But Randy
had never thought much about beauty or
personal adornment until the finding of the
wonderful fairy book. She had been dressed
like the other children in that little country
town, and had never seen a fashion book or
a stylishly dressed person in her life. Mrs.
Weston had taught her children to think
that to be neat and clean was to be well
dressed, and certainly Randy and Prue
were always dressed in clean gowns and
aprons, and stiff-starched sunbonnets. Yes,
Randy was more than pretty. Would she
one day know it?
</p>
<p>
Long and patient calling brought no answering
shout from little Prue, so Randy
snatched her sunbonnet from its peg on
the wall, and started in search of her.
She looked in every place, both possible
and impossible, and she laughed as she
thought of the funny scrapes the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
sister had gotten into. She thought of the
day on which their aunt, Miss Prudence
Weston, had come to visit them, bringing
three bags and as many bundles, although
she was to stay but a week.
</p>
<p>
She had always lived in a little town in
one of the Western states, and as that
week’s stay was her first visit to her brother’s
home, she was really a stranger to
Randy and Prue. The children had known
only that little Prue was her namesake,
and that she was a person well-nigh perfect.
</p>
<p>
“Your Aunt Prudence never did that,”
was a remark so frequently addressed to
little Prue that that lively, mischievous
little being conceived a great dislike for so
perfect a person; and, although she dared
not say so to either father or mother, she
confessed it freely to Randy when at night
they lay in their little bed in the chamber
under the eaves.
</p>
<p>
“I think it would be just horrid to live
in this house if Aunt Prudence lived here
too, don’t you, Randy?” said little Prue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
in a loud whisper. “You’re good, Randy,
and you know I love you, but you can be
naughty and Aunt Prudence can’t, that’s
the difference.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hush!” Randy had said. “I most
think it’s naughty not to like her. We
don’t know but may be she’s real nice if
we knew her.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t want to,” whispered Prue, “don’t
want to, <em>ever</em>. If she staid here I’d—I
mean I’d—” but the tired little sister had
gone fast asleep and left Randy to wonder
just what she would have done.
</p>
<p>
Immediately upon her arrival Miss Prudence
had removed her wraps, and had at
once taken out her knitting from a voluminous
pocket, saying to the two staring
children, as she peered at them over her
glasses, “It’s not right to waste time,” and
as soon as they had made their escape to
the kitchen, naughty little Prue had said,
“Randy Weston! If keeping busy would
make me look like that, I’d just do nothing
forever and ever.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
</p>
<p>
Funny little Prue! Aunt Prudence’s
sharp eyes behind her spectacles, her
“false front,” and tall, angular figure,
had strengthened the child’s preconceived
dislike. Then that day before their aunt
had bidden adieu to the Weston farm,
Randy had caught Prue perched upon a
chair, which made her just high enough
to see herself in the glass. On her head
was Miss Prudence’s best cap, on her saucy
little nose the big, old-fashioned spectacles,
over which she peered at herself, saying,
in imitation of her aunt, “I never waste
time, no, not a single minute.”
</p>
<p>
Randy had escaped to the barn where,
on the hay, she had laughed until she was
tired; all the time feeling guilty, for she
knew that, funny as the sight had been,
Prue had been very naughty. Prue was
a little captive in the house that afternoon,
a great trial for her, and at night
her father had talked with her and told
her that she must always be kind to every
one, especially to old people, and Prue had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
promised, at the same time saying that, “if
Aunt Prudence was always good, it was
easier for grown-up people to be good.”
</p>
<p>
Around the house and barn, down by the
well, and, lastly, into the barn went Randy,
calling, “Prue! Prue! where are you?”
</p>
<p>
“Here!” called a little voice.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” shouted Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Up here!” came the answer, which
appeared to come from the loft.
</p>
<p>
Up the ladder went Randy, and, once at
the top, she espied a funny little figure
sitting on the hay. “Why, Prue,” said
Randy, “what are you doing up here?
Why didn’t you come when I called?”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t,” said Prue; “I’m helping
mother, and I’ve got to stay. Mother said
you could help her make pies, so I came
up here and I’m sitting on some eggs. The
old hen’s left them, and mother said they’d
just got to be set on.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Prue!” said Randy, “you’d ought
to know better. If you’ve smashed them,
won’t you be a sight?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t smashed them,” said the child;
but upon Randy’s insisting, she rose from
the nest, only to show that not an egg
remained whole, as her pink calico dress
plainly showed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, <em>I</em> never got into such scrapes,”
said Randy, for once out of patience.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Randy,” said Prue, “don’t you
talk that way; that’s just like Aunt Prudence;”
and that silenced Randy completely.
</p>
<p>
Randy’s first thought was a longing to
shield Prue, but she knew that her mother
wished them always to come to her at once
when any mischief had been done, so, a forlorn
little procession of two, they walked
toward the house.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—AT THE BROOK</h2>
<p>
The next morning dawned bright and
fair. Randy awoke and rubbed her eyes.
“I believe there was something that made
me uncomfortable yesterday. Wonder what
it was?” thought she. “Don’t see what it
could have been,” mused the girl, half
awake. “I helped mother with the baking
and swept the kitchen for her, because I
knew I ought to, instead of reading that
fairy book. Then I hunted for Prue.—Oh,
that’s it! mother had to scold her, and
that always makes me feel just awful.
</p>
<p>
“She was naughty, and seems ’s if she
might know better than to get into such
queer scrapes, though she isn’t much more
than a baby.”
</p>
<p>
Here Randy turned over and looked at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
her little sister, who was still fast asleep.
“How pretty she looks!” said Randy, half
aloud. The sleeping child stirred, and
thrust one chubby arm and hand under her
short curls. She drew a long breath, which
was half a sigh, her eyelids quivered, opened,
closed, then opened wide, and she stared at
Randy, who, leaning upon her elbow, was
gazing at little Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Randy! what are you looking at
and thinking of?” said Prue, half laughing.
</p>
<p>
“I was just thinking,” said Randy, “that
when you’re asleep you don’t look as if you
could ever be naughty.”
</p>
<p>
Prue stopped laughing, and, putting her
arm around her sister’s neck, she said, “Oh,
Randy! I never mean to, and ’most always
when I’m naughty it’s when I’m trying to
help. Don’t you know that time when I
dropped the platter and broke it all to
smash? Mother put down the towel she
was wiping it with to look in the oven to
see if the bread was burning. I thought
I’d s’prise you and mother, and show you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
I’d wiped the big platter nice and dry. Just
a minute before, mother said it was too big
for me to handle, and that just made me
want to.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” said Randy, “I know you
mean to be good, and I do believe you can’t
help doing funny things, you best little
sister in all the world,” and she kissed
Prue, laughing at her at the same time.
“Now, do be good to-day, and, if you don’t
do a naughty thing before dinner, I’ll do
something splendid. I’ll have to help
mother this morning, and do a lot of
things. Then, of course, I’ll wipe the dinner
dishes, and after that you and I will go
down to that shady place by the brook, and
I’ll tell you some of the stories I read in
that book I found.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will you?” said Prue, “can you
’member them?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, some of them; I can’t remember
all of them yet,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you take the book and read
them?” said Prue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said Randy, “father’s got to
look it over and see if it’s a good book first,
mother says.”
</p>
<p>
“Why isn’t he ’fraid to read it, if
p’r’aps, it isn’t good?” said the child, with
such a funny expression on her face that
Randy, who really did not know how to
answer such a question, laughed, and said
she thought it must be time to dress.
</p>
<p>
Up sprang little Prue, and out upon the
floor. “You dress me first,” said she. So
Randy put on the little one’s shoes and
stockings, then, piece by piece, her other
little garments, all the time silently admiring
the round, dimpled arms, the roguish
eyes, and tangle of short curls, and the
sweet little mouth, honestly believing that
no girl in all the world had so dear
a little sister. Just as Randy turned to
button the little dress, Prue uttered a joyous
cry, and darted over to the window.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, come quick, quick!” she called.
“See the butterfly almost coming in our
window.” And sure enough, when Randy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
reached the window, there he was, a gorgeous
fellow, with bright, golden wings,
swinging up and down over a fresh rose-colored
morning-glory.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” cried Prue, “isn’t it the handsomest
butterfly you ever saw?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and look at the dewdrops on
the pink morning-glory,” said imaginative
Randy; “I wonder if the necklace that the
fairy queen wore looked as bright as that?
In the picture in the book it looks just like
strings and strings of beads.”
</p>
<p>
“I liked the beads and her dress, with a
long train to it; but in the picture she
didn’t have a nice face ’t all,” said Prue,
the young critic.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but she was bea-utiful,” said Randy.
“She must have been, the story said so,”
but just here Randy’s raptures over the
heroine of the fairy tale were cut short by
a loud call of “Randy! Randy! Prue! it’s
time to come downstairs!”
</p>
<p>
So Randy hurried on her own clothing,
and Prue amused herself while waiting by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
counting the buttons on Randy’s best gingham
dress as it hung on the first hook in
the closet, and this is the way she half said
and half sung it:—
</p>
<p>
“Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief,
doctor, lawyer,—Randy, what’s a lawyer?
Your last button is a lawyer.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Randy; “ask
father;” but when they had reached the
lowest stair and entered the kitchen Prue
had forgotten her question and asked another.
</p>
<p>
“Father,” she cried, “have you read the
book yet? Are you going to let Randy
read it? the fairy book, I mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Two questions in one,” said Mr. Weston,
laughing. “Why, yes, I guess I’ll have to
let her read it, if she wants to,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Going to let Randy read those outlandish
tales?” said Mrs. Weston coming out
of the closet with a pie in her hand, which
she placed upon the table. “Why there
wasn’t a word of truth in them.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” said her husband, smiling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
“but I didn’t see anything wrong about
them, and the yarns that are in the book
are so big that no sensible girl, like our
Randy, would s’pose she was expected to
believe them a minute. I looked it over
last night after I’d thought over that piece
of medder land of Jason Meade’s that he
wants to swap for my little pasture, and
cal-lated ’bout what the bargain was worth.
I just took down that fairy book from
behind the clock, and I thought I’d just
look it over to see if it was all right for
Randy and Prue, and, if you’d believe me,
’fore I knew it, I was ’most as interested
as the children was. As you say, there
ain’t any sense in it, but it reads kinder
fine, I must say.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston laughed, and said that she
was willing enough to let them have it if
the book was all right.
</p>
<p>
“Right enough,” rejoined her husband,
“only kind of foolish,” and smiling at the
children’s eager faces he said kindly, “Read
it if you like, only don’t let it make you
forget to help mother, Randy.”

<span class='caption'>Randy and Prue started for the Brook</span>
</div>
<p>
“Randy don’t often forget that,” said
Mrs. Weston, at which unwonted bit of
praise, Randy flushed with delight.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston was a hard-working woman
who loved her husband and children dearly,
but so busy was she, that she forgot to say
the encouraging word, or give the bit of
praise, justly won, which seems a reward
to the husband for his care and toil, and to
the child for “being good.”
</p>
<p>
When the hot forenoon’s work was done,
and the dinner dishes put away, Randy and
Prue started for the brook, Randy carrying
the wonderful book very carefully, and little
Prue skipping along beside her. Across
the fields, behind the barn, into a bit of
woodland went the children, and there they
found the brook, calm and placid in one
place, rippling and chattering in another.
“Hark! hear it talk,” said Randy, but practical
little Prue said, “It only says ‘wobble,
wobble, wobble,’ as it goes over the stones,
and I don’t call that talking.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do,” said Randy, “and I always
wonder what it says.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“How’ll you find out?” said Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Prue!” said Randy, “what makes
you ask questions that nobody could answer?”
</p>
<p>
“But somebody could,” said the child;
“if it really says anything, somebody, somewhere,
would know what it means, now
wouldn’t they, Randy?”
</p>
<p>
“I do believe there is some one who
could understand it.” Randy spoke so
earnestly that Prue stopped throwing pebbles
at the water-spiders and throwing her
arms around Randy, she said, “Oh, Randy!
don’t look that way. When your eyes
get big, and you just think and think, it
makes me lonesome. Do begin to read
the fairy stories.”
</p>
<p>
So Randy roused herself from her dream
about the brook, and sat down, with Prue
close beside her, on a rough plank which
spanned the tiny stream. There, with the
book upon her lap, and one arm around her
little sister, she read the tales of wonder
and enchantment, while the sunlight, sifting through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
the leaves, touched her hair
and made a halo around the sweet face.
Parts of the stories were too much for little
Prue to understand, but such of them as
her small brain could take in delighted her.
</p>
<p>
Randy read very well, although she had
had but little schooling, and her delight
in the splendor which the stories described
gave added expression to her reading, and
delighted little Prue exclaimed, “Oh, Randy,
you make it seem as if it was true!”
</p>
<p>
Randy laughed, well pleased with the compliment,
and continued reading: “‘And as
soon as she heard the witch’s voice, she unbound
her tresses.’”
</p>
<p>
“What’s ‘tresses’?” interrupted Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Why, hair,” explained Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Then, why didn’t they say ‘hair’?”
said the child.
</p>
<p>
“Tresses sounds nicer,” answered Randy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Prue, doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I do,” said Randy. “If my hair
was long, I’d enough rather have it called
tresses.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll call it tresses,” said obliging little
Prue, “even if it isn’t very long. Now, go
on, Randy.”
</p>
<p>
So Randy continued: “‘She unbound
her tresses, and they fell down twenty ells,
and the witch mounted up by them.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my, my!” interrupted Prue, “your
hair’s longer’n that!”
</p>
<p>
“Longer than what?” said the astonished
Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Twenty ells,” said Prue. “When you
showed me the other day how to print a
L, it wasn’t very big. Would twenty of
’em be so very much? Your hair is most
down to your waist, when I stretch the
ends out so they don’t curl.”
</p>
<p>
“O you funny child!” said Randy, half
laughing, half impatient. “It doesn’t mean
that kind of ell. What’s the use of reading
the stories? You ask so many questions,
I don’t believe you half hear them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do truly want to hear the stories,
and if you’ll only read, I won’t ask a question,
’less it’s something I can’t make out.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
Again Randy found the place, and for
some time the story went on without interruption.
Once they paused to see the
picture of the lovely girl in the tower, then
Randy went on:—
</p>
<p>
“‘The king’s son wished to ascend to her,
and looked for a door in the tower, but he
could not find one. So he rode home, but
the song which she had sung had touched
his heart so much that he went every day
to the forest and listened to it. As he thus
stood one day behind a tree, he saw the
witch come up and heard her call out:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Rapunzel,&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapunzel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&nbsp;&nbsp;down&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;&nbsp;hair.’<br />
</p>
<p>
“‘Then Rapunzel let down her tresses, and
the witch mounted up.’”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Randy!” cried Prue, excitedly,
“why, didn’t it ’most pull her head off?”
</p>
<p>
Randy laughed. “O Prue, Prue!” she
said, “I do believe you think of the funniest
questions to ask.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Randy, do you b’lieve it didn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
pull like everything?” And Prue’s eyes
were round with wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said Randy, “don’t you know
that father said we wouldn’t be expected
to believe the stories, only just enjoy them?”
But the little girl looked bewildered; so,
closing the book, Randy sought other means
to amuse her. “Let’s play this is a beautiful
bridge, this plank we’re sitting on, and
this brook, a great big river,” said Randy,
“and we’re princesses waiting for a prince
to come and save us—I mean rescue us,”
she corrected.
</p>
<p>
Again little Prue showed her lack of
imagination. “Save us from what?” said
she.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dragons that live in this big, roaring
river.”
</p>
<p>
“It don’t roar much,” said Prue, doubtfully;
“but,” she added, “we can play it
does.”
</p>
<p>
Thus encouraged, Randy went on, giving
her fancy full play. “And that pretty
green branch overhead, with sun on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
leaves, that’s an arch of flowers such as the
princess rode under in another story.”
</p>
<p>
That was too much for Prue. “But,
Randy!” she exclaimed, “there isn’t a
blossom on it. If we were princesses,
Randy, I could love you just the same,
couldn’t I?” questioned Prue, looking up
at her sister with eager eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Of course you could,” said Randy, giving
Prue a hug, who thus assured began to
hum a little tune, swinging her legs to keep
time with her singing. They made a pretty
picture, Randy with her arm still about the
little sister, Prue nestling as close as possible
to Randy, and in the brook below a reflection
showing the two children. Randy was
looking off as if for the coming of the
prince, while little Prue, becoming drowsy,
laid her head against her sister.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Prue started: “S’pose that’s
the prince?” said she, as a low, merry
whistle sounded through the woods. Randy
looked toward the opening, then her laugh
rang out. “Oh, Prue,” said she, “it’s ’Bijah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
Bowstock, the deacon’s hired man, going
after the cows. Just look at him!” she
added. And Prue looked.
</p>
<p>
Little enough like the prince in the fairy
book looked he! An old straw hat upon the
back of his head, a blue “jumper,” and a
pair of overalls tucked into his boots, completed
his costume. He did not see Randy
and Prue as he passed through the woods
to a path far beyond the brook, whisking
off the blossoms with his switch as he went
along.
</p>
<p>
“His clothes wasn’t the kind the prince
wore in the picture, was they, Randy?”
said Prue, when ’Bijah was out of sight.
“In the picture in the fairy book they wear
such long, long stockings way over their
knees, and hats with feathers in them, and
everything,” said Prue, intending thus to
supply all the details of costume which she
might possibly have omitted.
</p>
<p>
Randy made no answer. Little Prue felt
as many a grown person does, that the
clothes made the man; but Randy, thoughtful Randy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
felt that, given all the fine raiment,
’Bijah never could have even <em>looked</em>
the prince.
</p>
<p>
Little Prue edged her way along the
plank on which they sat, and at last succeeded
in slipping off from the end of the
board down to the edge of the brook.
There she found bits of bark which she
freighted with moss, and then floated them
down the tiny stream.
</p>
<p>
The little crafts, aided by a gentle push,
floated out into a placid little pool just
under Randy’s feet. For an instant they
paused, wavered, then turning about they
flew over the miniature rapids, made there
by three small stones below the surface,
then sailed around a bend in the brook and
disappeared behind a clump of brakes growing
at the foot of an alder.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the tiny boats foundered, and
the passengers were tipped out into the
stream, but little Prue found other bits of
bark for the boats and gaily loaded them
with moss for more passengers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
</p>
<p>
“Look, Randy! Look!” screamed Prue,
“there’s a fine new boat just under your
feet. The gray moss is mens, and the moss
with the red tops is womens. The red is
their bonnets. Randy, Randy! why don’t
you hear me when I’m close to you?”
</p>
<p>
Randy shook herself and sat upright,
laughing. “I did hear you,” she said,
“only I didn’t think to answer. I guess I
was dreaming.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, don’t dream in the daytime!”
said Prue; “I’ve sent lots and lots of pretty
boats down the stream, and I kept telling
you to look, and now I don’t believe you’ve
seen one of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I have,” said Randy, “only I
was so busy thinking that I didn’t say anything
about them. Come, we’ll sail a few
boats together, and then I guess we’d better
go home.”
</p>
<p>
Prue was delighted, and to reward Randy
for agreeing to play with her, she hunted
with all her might for finer pieces of bark
and choicer bits of moss, and gay indeed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
was the little fleet with its red-capped crew
and passengers. Prue wandered off to find
even finer mosses, and Randy was trying
to capture a big water-spider for a passenger
for a piece of birch bark, when Prue
came rushing down the path, crying, “Look,
Randy! Look! Here’s old Mr. Plimpkins
to sail in one of our boats.”
</p>
<p>
In her surprise Randy let the water-spider
escape, and, turning about, saw Prue quite
alone, running toward her, laughing and
holding out something which she had in
her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Prue Weston! what do you mean?”
said Randy.
</p>
<p>
Old Mr. Plimpkins was a farmer who
lived at the outskirts of the town, but Prue
had seen him at church, and she thought
him the funniest man she had ever seen.
</p>
<p>
He was nearly as broad as he was tall.
Winter and summer, he habitually wore
very broad-brimmed hats, and he walked
with a comical waddle, because his legs
were completely bowed. As if to attract
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
attention to these members, they were always
encased in light, snuff-colored trousers,
while about his neck, hot weather or cold,
was always wrapped an immense red plaid
cotton handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
As Prue came along, she handed out
to Randy the object which she called
Mr. Plimpkins, and, sure enough, clutched
tightly in the little hot hand, was a bit
of twig on which two stems bowed together
until they nearly touched. On it, for a
broad-brimmed hat, she had stuck a round
green leaf.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I think it must be naughty to laugh
about him, even if he is funny,” said
Randy.
</p>
<p>
“But doesn’t it look like him?” persisted
Prue, “besides, <em>you’re</em> laughing, Randy,
only not out loud.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Randy was laughing, so, without
attempting to reprove the little sister, she
placed the bit of birch, which represented
the old farmer, on the bark, and watched
Prue as she floated it down the stream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
Then, turning toward home, they walked
along the path which led to the entrance to
the wood.
</p>
<p>
Prue sang all the way, and, seeing her
happiness, Randy, sweet Randy, felt rewarded
for the afternoon given up to her
little sister’s amusement; but she felt that
the reading of the fairy tales was not a
success. Clearly, the stories were beyond
little Prue; for, at the supper table, when
there was a pause in the conversation, she
described the afternoon and Randy’s reading,
much to Randy’s surprise and her
father’s amusement.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father!” she exclaimed, “we’ve
been down to the brook, sailing boats, an’
Randy read me the beautifulest story! The
girl’s name was—I’ve forgotten what, but
her hair comed down to the ground, and
the prince clumb up on it, and ’most pulled
her head off, and the tower was so small the
old witch couldn’t live in it, and she cut
her hair off, and that’s all I can think of,
’cept the girl sang all the time, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
prince could hear her, and we sat on the
plank and waited for the prince to come.”
</p>
<p>
All this she said in one breath. Her
father laughed heartily at her manner of
telling the story, but Mrs. Weston said,
“What on airth does the child mean?”
while Randy decided to read the stories to
herself, thereafter, and amuse Prue in another
way.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—RANDY AT CHURCH</h2>
<p>
“Come, Randy, come! It wants a quarter
to ten, an’ you’d better hurry.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, mother, I’m coming,” said Randy,
pleasantly, and with redoubled energy she
reached for the middle button of her dress
waist, which was fastened at the back.
This button was just too high for her left
hand to reach up to, and almost too low for
her right hand to reach down to, but at last
she succeeded in crowding the refractory
little button into its buttonhole, and, flushed
with the struggle, she stood before the tiny
looking-glass brushing a stray curling lock
from her temple. The glass was a poor
one, and Randy’s reflection appeared to be
making a most unpleasant grimace at the
real girl standing there. When she lifted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
her chin, a flaw in the glass made one eye
appear much larger than the other, and
when she bent her head, you would never
have believed that the little nose in the glass
was a reproduction of Randy’s, so singular
was its contour. Truly, with such mirrors
as the farm-house afforded, Randy stood
little chance of becoming vain.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Randy!” Randy started, took
one more look at the stiff gingham dress,
then hastened down the stairs. At the
door stood Mrs. Weston, impatiently waiting
for her, while little Prue patted the old
cat and told her that she “mustn’t be lonesome
while they were all at church.”
</p>
<p>
Into the wagon they climbed, and away
they started to the church. Their progress
was slow, for the old horse was far from a
“racer” at any time, and on Sunday Mr.
Weston felt it to be wrong to more than
walk the horse; yet, even with such slow
locomotion, they did at last reach the church,
and the old horse was duly ensconced in the
carriage-shed to dream away the forenoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
</p>
<p>
The Westons had arrived a bit early,
and Randy amused herself surveying the
few parishioners who had already come.
In that country town the neighbors were
few and far between. The Westons’ nearest
neighbor was about a mile and a half
distant, and so on Sundays it was quite a
treat to see so many people.
</p>
<p>
There were the Babson girls just a few
pews in front of Randy. Randy thought
Belinda Babson very pretty, mainly because
of her fine yellow braids of straight hair.
These braids lay down Belinda’s broad
back, falling quite below her waist.
</p>
<p>
Her sister Jemima’s braids were even
thicker and longer; but then, Randy reflected,
Jemima’s braids were red.
</p>
<p>
There was Jotham Potts, whose black
eyes always espied Randy at church or
school, but whose regard she did not at
all value. True, on one hot Sunday when
Randy had found it well-nigh impossible
to keep awake, Jotham had reached over
the top of the pew and dropped some big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
peppermints in her lap. His intention was
good, and Randy blushed and was delighted,
although her pleasure was partly spoiled
by a snicker from Phœbe Small, who longed
to win Jotham’s admiration, but thus far
had failed to gain it. Randy had inspected
every boy and girl in the church and was
just watching a big blue fly that was circling
around a web in the angle of the window,
when a slight stir among the occupants
of the other pews caused Randy to look
around and become delighted with a sweet
vision. With Farmer Gray and his wife
came a number of ladies and gentlemen;
summer boarders who were to be at the
Gray homestead a number of weeks; but
to Randy’s eyes, the young lady who took
a seat next to Mrs. Gray seemed a dream
of beauty. She wore a simple white muslin
and a very large hat trimmed with daisies,
but to the little country maid the city
girl’s costume was nothing short of magnificent.
</p>
<p>
It had always been Randy’s delight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
when the choir arose to sing, to watch
Miss Dobbs, the little woman who sang
soprano, as she drew herself up to her full
height in a vain attempt to catch a glimpse
of the page of the hymn book, the other
half of which was held by Silas Barnes,
the phenomenally tall tenor. Equally
amusing was the tall, thin woman who
sang “second,” standing beside her cousin,
John Hobson, who sang bass with all his
might. He was short, fat, and very dark,
and his musical efforts, which were mighty,
caused a scowl upon his usually jovial countenance,
and a deal of perspiration as well.
</p>
<p>
But to-day when the choir arose, Randy
had no eyes for any one but the Grays’
lovely boarder, and she almost held her
breath as she wondered if the girl would
sing.
</p>
<p>
The tall tenor touched his tuning fork,
the choir sounded the chord, then choir
and congregation joined in singing the old
missionary hymn, “From Greenland’s Icy
Mountains,” and round and full rang out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
the sweet contralto voice of the tall, fair
girl in white.
</p>
<p>
Randy was spellbound. She had never
admired that hymn, but to-day it sounded
sweeter than anything she had ever heard.
Little Prue looked at the singer with round
eyes, and as they sat down she clutched
Randy’s skirts and in a loud whisper said,
“Oh, Randy, do you s’pose she is the fairy
princess?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, hush!” said Randy, alarmed lest
the young girl should hear the child.
</p>
<p>
Did she hear her? She sat in the pew
just in front of the Westons’, and when Prue
whispered her eager question, a faint suggestion
of a smile hovered about the lovely
mouth, and a bright twinkle glimmered
for an instant in her beautiful eyes.
</p>
<p>
Just then Parson Spooner arose, gave out
the text, and commenced one of his long sermons.
He was a good man, with a kindly
word and smile for every one, and all of his
people were devoutly fond of him. The people
liked him, and he always had a pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
chat with every child whom he met, and
most of them thought that he was “lots”
nicer on week-days than on Sundays. On
week-days he talked with the boy whom he
chanced to meet with his fishing-rod over
his shoulder, and laughingly wished him
good luck. Or, if it happened that the
small owner of a home-made kite could
not make it fly, the genial parson had
been known to tie a new bob (usually a
few weeds tied together) to the tail of the refractory
kite, and off it would sail to the delight
of the small boy and his clerical friend.
</p>
<p>
But on Sundays, his sermons, delivered
in a drowsy sing-song, tried the patience of
his small parishioners. Prue and Randy
settled down as if for a long day of it, and
Randy resolved that, however long the sermon
might be, she would not get sleepy;
whereupon, she stretched her eyes to their
fullest extent, and stared at nothing so
persistently, that Prue became uneasy, and
whispered, “What’s the matter, Randy?
you look so queer!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Randy. “I just mean
to keep my eyes open, that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“They <em>are</em> open, just monstrous!” said
Prue, at which Randy could not help laughing.
As the little girl was not aware that
she had said anything that was at all
funny, she thought Randy’s amusement
quite out of place, and sat quietly for a few
moments, in injured silence.
</p>
<p>
Randy tried very hard to attend to the
sermon, but in spite of good intentions, her
mind wandered from Parson Spooner’s
flushed face, as he proceeded to make his
meaning clear by loud vocal efforts, and to
enforce his meaning by many thumps of
his fat fist upon the pulpit cushion.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Brimblecom sat over by the window,
slowly waving a palm-leaf fan to and fro,
and occasionally nudging her husband, to
keep him awake. In front of her, sat Joel
Simpkins, his sandy hair brushed so carefully
that not one hair was awry, and just across
the aisle, Janie Clifton sat, in all the glory
of a new pink calico. Janie’s black curls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
were very pretty, and she knew it; and her
bright, black eyes had been pointedly
praised in an alleged poem, which had
appeared in the county paper a few weeks
before. It was entitled the “Black-eyed
Coquette,” and Janie felt sure that Joel
had written it, in which case, its boldly
expressed flattery could have been meant
for none other than herself. Accordingly,
she shook her curls, and occasionally looked
at Joel, in a manner which Randy considered
shockingly bold, and she wondered if,
at eighteen, she could act like that. She
decided that she could never be so bold, not
even if the object of her admiration looked
like a prince.
</p>
<p>
She thought, too, that Joel was very
ordinary; then she looked again at the girl
in the daisy-trimmed hat and white muslin
gown, and fell to wondering how fine and
handsome a prince would have to be to gain
her favor.
</p>
<p>
“Probably there isn’t any one in these
parts that would please her,” thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
Randy. “’Tisn’t only her clothes,” mused
she, “it’s something else that makes her
different from the folks around here.”
</p>
<p>
All this time Prue had been unusually
still, and Randy looked to see if she was
asleep. The little girl was very wide
awake, and sat staring at the large hat in
front of her, her lips moving as if she were
counting. Prue’s manner of counting was
something unique, and as Randy bent her
head to listen, she could hardly help laughing,
for this is what she heard:—
</p>
<p>
“One, two, four, five, two, six, ten, nine,
two,—oh, Randy, there’s more daisies on
her hat than I can count. Are they truly
daisies? If they are, why don’t they wilt?”
</p>
<p>
“Hush-sh-sh,” said Randy. “Keep still
and watch that big bumble bee that’s just
come in the window.”
</p>
<div><a name='f046' id='f046'></a></div>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<span class='caption'>Prue counts the Daisies on Miss Dayton’s Hat</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>
“Hear him bum,” said Prue, thus making
Randy laugh again. She felt very wicked,
laughing in church, and knew that her
father would not approve; but how could
she help laughing, for while she watched
the bee, and wondered where he would fly
next, little Prue watched him, too, all the
time softly imitating his monotonous tune
by saying under her breath, “bum, bum,
bum.”
</p>
<p>
The heat increased, and Prue looked out
of the window at the green branches moving
in the breeze, and longed to be out there,
too. At last the bee tired of the church
and flew out of the window, and just as
Randy was thinking that she could not
bear the heat, Parson Spooner’s sermon
came to an end. He had become entangled
in his own eloquence; and seeing no way
to extricate himself, or make his meaning
clear, he abruptly closed his sermon and
suggested singing the Doxology.
</p>
<p>
After the service Mrs. Gray stopped to
talk with Mrs. Weston, and then, to the
mingled delight and embarrassment of Randy
and Prue, the beautiful stranger turned,
and, stooping, spoke to the little girl.
</p>
<p>
“How very good you have been,” said
she, “to sit still this long, hot morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
Do you know I had some candy in my
pocket which I longed to share with you,
but I didn’t like to turn quite around, as I
should have had to, to give it to you. Let
me give it to you now, and you and your
sister can enjoy it during the long ride
home. See!” And from a pretty chatelaine
bag which hung from her belt, she
took a small box of bonbons. “If I give
you this, will you give me a kiss?” And
she stooped and placed the gift in Prue’s
eager little hands.
</p>
<p>
For an instant the child hesitated; then
shyly she lifted her face, and as the young
girl stooped to take the kiss, Prue’s pudgy
little arm went around her neck.
</p>
<p>
Then, turning to Randy, she extended
her hand in its dainty glove, saying, “I
have seen you and your sister many times
when I have strolled past your home, and
once, when you were standing near the tall
clump of sunflowers, watching the bees, I
was tempted to stop and chat with you
awhile.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wish you had,” said Randy, so
eagerly, that the girl laughed merrily, saying,
“Well, the next time I am out for a
walk and am going up the long hill, I will
make you a little call.”
</p>
<p>
Just at that moment Mrs. Weston’s
friendly chat with her neighbor came to an
end, and with her usual hasty manner she
hurried the two children out of the church
and into the old wagon. Mr. Weston gathered
up the reins, and with a loud “g’lang”
and a few jerks, the old horse seemed to
awaken from his forenoon’s nap in the
carriage-shed and ambled a few steps, then
subsided into the habitual jog.
</p>
<p>
“Look, mother, just see what she
gave me,” said Prue, swinging the tiny
package of bonbons before her mother’s
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” said her mother; “who
gave it to you?”
</p>
<p>
“The princess,” said Prue, as plainly as
she could, considering the size of the bonbon
which she was eating. Mrs. Weston
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
looked puzzled, and Randy, helping herself
to a bit of the candy, explained:—
</p>
<p>
“It was that beautiful, tall girl with
Mrs. Gray. She gave Prue the candy for
being good and keeping still this morning,
and she’s coming to see me soon’s
ever she takes a walk past our house,
and isn’t she the handsomest person that
ever lived?”
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I don’t know as I noticed,” said
Mrs. Weston.
</p>
<p>
“Why, how could you help seeing her?”
said Randy, in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I s’pose I did see her, but I
didn’t ’specially notice her, ’cept that
she was talkin’ to you children, for Mrs.
Gray was tellin’ me a new way to make
cookies with two eggs instead of four,
and I made her tell me twice so’s I’d remember;
two eggs is quite a savin’.”
But this new bit of economy was lost on
Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Did Mrs. Gray tell you her name?”
asked Randy, eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me she said it was Dayton, or
something like that, but I was so took up
with that two-egg rule for cookies that I
didn’t notice.” So, failing to interest her
mother, Randy subsided.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—PRUE’S MISHAP</h2>
<p>
Down the long, dusty road trudged Randy
and Prue one hot morning on their way to
the village store.
</p>
<p>
At every step the dust arose like smoke,
then settled upon their shoes, making a
thick coating like that which whitened the
blackberry vines growing luxuriantly over
the wall by the roadside.
</p>
<p>
Randy was far from pleased to be taking
this long walk in the dust and heat. She
had been sitting upon the rough, wooden
seat just outside the kitchen door, reading
the beloved fairy book, when her mother
had stepped briskly to the doorway, calling
her back from fairyland abruptly, saying:
“Come, Randy, you must go down to the
store after some sugar. I’ve got my cookies ’bout half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
done and my sugar’s given
out, so you must put on your sunbonnet
and take Prue, and go as quick as you can.
Ye needn’t run, only don’t waste time.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother,” said Randy, “it’ll take me
twice as long if I have to take Prue, she’s
so little, and she walks so slow.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it,” said Mrs. Weston, “but
I’ve got lots to do while you’re gone, and I
can’t watch her and work at the same
time; so you take her ’long o’ you, and I’ll
know she’s all right.”
</p>
<p>
Randy took her sunbonnet from its peg
on the wall and called little Prue, who was
playing in the sun. The child’s delight
when told that she might go to the store
with Randy made the elder girl regret that
she had demurred when told that she must
take her little sister with her.
</p>
<p>
Prue laughed with delight, and, thrusting
her little sunburned hand into Randy’s,
she trudged along, scuffling her feet and
laughing to see the dust rise in little gray
clouds.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
</p>
<p>
At any other time Randy would have
checked Prue, but that day her mind was
too much occupied with the heroine of the
fairy tale to notice Prue’s movements or
comment upon them; but Prue was getting
tired of walking in silence, while Randy
indulged herself in day-dreams.
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you talk, Randy? You
haven’t talked any since we started,” said
Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s too hot to talk,” answered
Randy, and she once more relapsed into
silence.
</p>
<p>
Prue dropped Randy’s hand, and, leaving
the road, she clambered upon the wall to
hunt among the dusty vines for blackberries.
There were more leaves than fruit,
so the little girl, after finding a few small
berries, walked along upon the wall until
she came to another lot of vines, where she
again searched for fruit.
</p>
<p>
While Prue looked for berries Randy was
critically inspecting her own and her little
sister’s costume. How ugly they looked!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
The girl who, up to that time, had never
seen any one arrayed in anything more
beautiful than a print or gingham gown,
varied by a long apron of blue-checked cotton,
or a dark, chocolate-colored calico, now
looked with startling dislike upon that
style of apparel.
</p>
<p>
“Only think,” mused Randy, “if we
wore white dresses and fine shoes, and big
hats, ’twouldn’t seem near as hot doing
errands. Seems as though we could sit
still in meeting if we had on different
clothes and—why, Prue, what’s the matter?”
cried Randy, in answer to a doleful
wail from the little sister.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my foot, my foot!” screamed Prue;
“it hurts drefful, and I can’t get it out.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me see,” said Randy. “Hold still a
minute; I can get it out, Prue,” which, however,
proved to be easier said than done.
While walking upon the wall the little
foot had slipped between the stones and
seemed firmly fixed.
</p>
<p>
Randy worked gently and patiently, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
at last the little foot was out of prison.
Prue insisted upon having her shoe and
stocking taken off, saying that her foot
felt “awful big,” and sure enough it had
become a trifle swollen. Randy tried in
every way to soothe her, assuring her that
it was but a short walk to the store, but
Prue wailed dismally.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I can’t walk, Randy, my foot aches
just drefful, and I can’t have any shoes on,
’cause my foot has grown big.”
</p>
<p>
Randy blamed herself for the mishap.
“I ought to have been taking care of Prue
instead of thinking of fine clothes,” thought
Randy. “It ought to have been me that
got hurt instead of little Prue. ’Twould
have served me right for being real silly,
almost vain, I do believe.” And thus she
berated herself.
</p>
<p>
Poor, repentant Randy! Careless she
had been, but surely not wicked. She
was utterly at a loss to know what to do.
“Don’t you think you could walk slowly,
Prue, if I put my hands under your arms
to help you?” she asked coaxingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“Randy, how can I walk when this foot
is most twice as big as my other foot?” said
Prue.
</p>
<p>
Randy thought a moment. Then she
said: “There’s only one thing to do, Prue.
You can look right down the road and see
the store from here. You sit still where
you are, and I’ll run and get the sugar; it
won’t take but a few minutes, and when I
get back I’ll carry you home in my arms.
You can hold the sugar and I’ll carry
you.”
</p>
<p>
Prue tried bravely to stop crying, and
although she declared that her foot felt
“worser,” she promised to be patient until
Randy should return. The store was in
the front part of a farm-house but a short
distance from where the two sat upon the
wall, and Randy rushed off down the road
and in at the open door, in such evident
haste that Silas Barnes looked at the girl
in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“In a kind of hurry, ain’t ye?” said he,
as in his usual deliberate manner he weighed
the sugar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, oh, yes,” answered Randy, as she
almost snatched the bundle and darted out
of the door and ran up the road to where
Prue sat upon the wall, a most disconsolate
little heap, trying very hard to be brave,
but sobbing in spite of all endeavor.
</p>
<p>
“Now, you carry the sugar—just think
what a sweet bundle—and I’ll take you.
My arms are real strong, so I believe I can
carry you easily.”
</p>
<p>
Prue hugged the parcel, and taking her
little sister in her arms Randy stepped out
bravely toward home. It seemed to her
that she could not remember such intense
heat as she that day experienced. They
had taken off their sunbonnets as they
sat upon the wall, and in their haste they
had started for home, leaving them where
they had dropped them, so that their heads
were unprotected from the scorching rays
of the sun, which was now directly overhead.

<span class='caption'>Randy carrying Prue in her Arms</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>
Many times Randy was obliged to set
Prue upon the wall, just long enough to
rest her aching arms; then taking her
again, she bravely trudged on toward
home.
</p>
<p>
Just as she concluded that her arms
would surely break, she heard the sound
of wheels behind her, and looking over
her shoulder she saw Obadiah Gray’s old
mare, Clover, jogging along and in the
wagon the beautiful young girl whom
she had so much admired at church.
</p>
<p>
“There’s that pretty girl whom I saw in
church last Sunday,” thought Helen Dayton.
“How much prettier she looks without
that ugly sunbonnet. Why, she has
her little sister in her arms, and the little
one is crying. I’ll stop and speak to them.”
Old Clover, always delighted to stop, came
to a standstill, and Randy looked up shyly
at Helen’s beautiful face.
</p>
<p>
“Are you not tired?” said Miss Dayton.
“I see that you are carrying your little
sister.” Then, as she noticed the swollen
foot, she said: “Oh, how did she hurt her
foot? Do let me take you home.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
Randy was only too glad to accept the
invitation so sweetly given; so Prue was
gently lifted to a place beside Miss Dayton,
and then Randy clambered in, not only
thankful for the ride, but positively charmed
to be with the lovely driver.
</p>
<p>
“Now, tell me,” said Helen, “how your
little sister injured her foot.” So Randy
told her the whole story, and blamed herself
more than she deserved. “If I hadn’t been
wishing that I had a big, beautiful hat
like”—but here Randy stopped abruptly,
as she noticed, for the first time, that Miss
Dayton was wearing the very hat and dress
which so filled her mind that morning.
</p>
<p>
“What was the hat like? Anything
like the one I am wearing this morning?”
asked Helen, sweetly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, yes, just like it,” admitted
Randy, blushing.
</p>
<p>
“Did you so much admire my hat?” said
Helen. “Well, who knows but that on
some fine day you may have one quite like
it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
When, at last, they had reached Randy’s
home, both Prue and Randy had become
quite well acquainted with their new
friend.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston had just come in from the
field, in answer to a blast from the dinner
horn, and was as anxious as his wife when
told that the children had been gone two
hours and a half. “I guess I’ll have to
harness up and go down to the store and
see if they’re—sakes alive! Here they be
now, with that ’stonishing pretty boarder of
Obadiah Gray’s,” and Mr. Weston hastened
down the walk to thank the young lady for
her kindness.
</p>
<p>
“I’m much ’bleeged to ye for bringing
the children home; mother and I was getting
anxious. Randy, here, is going on
fifteen, and pretty tall of her age, but we
still call them the children, and Randy,
she’s reliable; so, when she don’t appear at
the right time, we know that something’s
up. Why, Prue, where’s your shoe and
stocking?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father,” said Randy, “you won’t
say I was reliable this time.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mr. Weston,” said Helen Dayton,
“Randy blames herself for Prue’s injured
foot, but she has bravely carried her little
sister up the long hill from the store, and I
think accuses herself too harshly.”
</p>
<p>
“Like enough,” said Randy’s father.
“Randy’s conscience is all out of proportion
to her size.” Then, once more thanking
Helen heartily for her kindness, he took
little Prue into his arms saying, kindly:
“There, there, little daughter, I wouldn’t
cry any more. You’re home now, and
mother’ll know just how to fix your foot
all right; and, Randy, ye may have let yer
thoughts wander, so to speak, but you
didn’t make Prue hurt her foot, and ye’ve
more than made up fer it all by bein’ so
truly sorry, and tryin’ to bring her home.
She’s a little girl, but she’s solid for a girl
of your size to carry. ‘Stead of blamin’
and accusin’ yourself, you just help mother
to make Prue comfortable, and then you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
amuse her with the fairy book, and, may
be, she’ll forget how bad her foot aches.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do it,” said Randy, delighted to
think that she could in any way be useful
to her little sister, and so well did she
amuse her that in the middle of the sixth
fairy tale Prue was sound asleep.
</p>
<p>
As soon as Mrs. Weston had seen the
little foot, she had given it a bath in hot
water, bound securely about it a hot bandage,
and told little Prue that she must be
quite still.
</p>
<p>
“I will, if Randy will read to me,” said
Prue. So Randy read story after story,
until the little sister was asleep.
</p>
<p>
Randy sat beside her, intending to read
to her again if she awoke, but Prue had
cried with the aching foot until she was
very tired, so she slept soundly. Once she
stirred, and thrust her chubby hand under
her head, murmuring as she did so. Randy
bent over her, to hear what she said.
</p>
<p>
“The big stones squeezed my foot, so
course it wasn’t my Randy did it,” murmured Prue. “My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
Randy wouldn’t do
such a thing to me. My Randy’s just about
right always and she—” but here her voice
faltered and that which commenced in a
sentence ended in a sigh. A bright tear
glistened in Randy’s gray eyes. How lovingly
little Prue held her above the possibility
of anything wrong.
</p>
<p>
“I must try hard to be as good as Prue
thinks I am,” thought Randy, and, bending,
she kissed the little one ever so gently so as
not to awaken her; “for,” thought Randy,
“while she sleeps she doesn’t know her foot
aches, and when she wakes I’ll read or do
anything she wishes me to, to amuse her.”
</p>
<p>
And Randy kept her promise. The
injury, although not serious, was quite painful,
and Prue declared that Randy was
“’most an angel,” so patient and entertaining
was she, reading the same story over
and over again if it chanced to please her.
</p>
<p>
In a few days Prue was able to be about,
and Randy was every bit as happy as her
little sister, to see that the swelling had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
disappeared and the wee foot back to its
usual size. There was one story with which
Prue seemed the most pleased and which she
wished oftenest to hear.
</p>
<p>
That was the story of the “Sleeping
Beauty,” but it mattered not how many
times she heard it, she never could tell it
straight.
</p>
<p>
One day Prue’s mother said that the
little girl would be wise if she rested her
foot all the afternoon. “I’ll sit still on
the ‘lunge,’” said Prue, “if you’ll listen to
a bea-utiful story called the ‘Sleeping
Beauty.’ I guess I can tell it ’most right;
do you want to hear it, mother?”
</p>
<p>
Now this was a trial to Mrs. Weston’s
patience. She had glanced hastily at a few
pages of the fairy book and had declared it
to be “clear foolishness,” adding, “if it
amuses Randy and Prue, I do’no as I care;
but it puzzles me how they can enjoy it.”
</p>
<p>
But, thinking to please her little daughter
and make her willing to sit still, she promised
to listen attentively to Prue’s narrative,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
adding under her breath, “I guess I can
stand it for once, if it is foolish.” So she
handed the book to Prue, who declared that,
although she couldn’t read, she could tell
the story better by looking at the pictures.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston brought her sewing to the
window nearest the lounge where Prue sat
as if enthroned, and the youthful entertainer
commenced at once to tell the story
as she remembered it. As Randy afterward
said with stifled laughter, “If that is
the best Prue could tell the story with the
pictures to help her, how much more could
she have twisted it without the book?”
</p>
<p>
“Once upon a time (they all commence
that way),” said Prue, “there was a little
girl so be-autiful that folks ’most went
crazy who saw her, an’ her father was
tickled to see how handsome she was when
she was a baby; an’ one time when she
was fifteen (that’s what Randy is)—no, I
forgot, when the baby, that’s the princess,
you know, was a bein’ chris-chris-chris-tened,
there was a lot of fairies that bringed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
her presents, and one was mad because she
didn’t be invited, and she did something
awful, but I’ve forgot what.
</p>
<p>
“Then the beautiful princess went to
sleep a hun-dred years” (here Prue’s eyes
grew round with excitement), “and she
grew older and older every minute—no,
no, she didn’t. I mean she didn’t grow
older a’ tall.”
</p>
<p>
Here Randy turned hastily to gaze out
of the window, and Prue, fortunately, failed
to notice her sister’s very evident effort to
conceal her amusement.
</p>
<p>
“Then everybody in the house—no, palace—went
sound asleep and snored, and
they never waked up ’til the prince kissed
them—oh, no, he only kissed the princess.
Mother, why do you s’pose he didn’t kiss
anybody but the princess? Shouldn’t you
a thought he would?”
</p>
<p>
Without waiting for an answer, however,
Prue babbled on.
</p>
<p>
“They was married and lived happy ever
after, and all the folks waked up, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
horses, and cows, and cats, and dogs, all
wagged their tails ’cause they was awake
too. Isn’t that a wonderful story?”
</p>
<p>
“I should say it was,” ejaculated practical
Mrs. Weston. “Nothing less than
wonderful.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston folded the garment which
she had been mending, and saying, kindly,
“That was a long story for a little girl to
try to tell,” she went out to the kitchen to
make preparation for tea, leaving Prue still
looking at the pictures in the fairy book.
Randy stole out to the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother,” she said, looking up wistfully,
“I know you think it funny that I
can like fairy stories almost as well as Prue
does; but, truly, Prue does not tell them
straight. They’re not true, of course, but
they do sound pretty when you read them
straight through instead of ‘mixed up’ as
she gets them.”
</p>
<p>
“I know, of course,” said her mother,
“that Prue has a funny way of telling anything.
If you enjoy the stories, I’m sure I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
don’t care, only don’t ask me to read them.
I want to read something that’s somewhat
probable,” and Randy was obliged to be
satisfied with that.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston’s mind was utterly void of
imagination, and to read to her of magic
locks, of sleep which, lasting a hundred
years, left the sleeper youthful and beautiful,
of wild wishes granted, of people
turned to stone, and back to life again,
simply tried her patience and amused her
not at all.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—HELEN DAYTON’S CALL</h2>
<p>
The sun shone in at the kitchen window
and made a golden panel on the floor.
</p>
<p>
“Looks like another hot day,” said Mrs.
Weston, and she paused a moment and
looked out at the meadow, where the little
brook sparkled in the sun.
</p>
<p>
“Mother, are we very poor?” said Randy,
irrelevantly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston wheeled around abruptly in
her surprise, and promptly dropped the
dishcloth which she held in her hand.
“There,” said she, “look at that dishcloth;
somebody’s comin’ sure as preachin’. I
never knew it to fail.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do hope somebody will, if it’s Miss
Dayton, if that’s her name,” added Randy.
“But you didn’t answer what I asked you,”
said the girl. “<em>Are</em> we, mother?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy, what’s in your mind?
Lately you’ve been dreamin’ most of the
time, and askin’ queer questions between
times. Are we what? Poor? Why no,
I do’no’s we be. Your father ain’t a rich
man, but he’s well-to-do. What put it in
your head to ask me?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing,” said Randy, “only I was
wondering what the reason was that all
the folks in church yesterday looked so
different from Mrs. Gray’s boarders. Was
it because they were poorer or was it some
other reason?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mrs. Weston, as she took
the towel from Randy’s listless hands, and
commenced energetically to finish wiping
the dishes, “I guess we’re as well fixed as
any one around here; your father owes
nobody nothin’, and our farm’s one of the
biggest and best in the town. I’ve heard
say that some city folks was rich, an’ I
heard tell of other city folks as wasn’t
so well off as their clothes seemed to make
them out; and as to our lookin’ different,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
there ain’t any call to dress up any more
than what we do now. I tell you what,
Randy, to be clean and neat ought to
satisfy any one.”
</p>
<p>
To this Randy could not agree, so she
wisely said nothing. In her inmost heart
she knew that, were she the possessor of
an immense hat loaded with flowers, she
would not have the courage to walk into
church, the cynosure of all eyes. On the
other hand, a sunbonnet never had looked
so uncouth and unbecoming as now.
</p>
<p>
The dishes put away, the chickens fed,
and a dozen other little chores attended to,
Randy was free to do as she liked; so off
to the “best” room she flew, eager to
brighten it in any way which might
suggest itself. The best room was a front
room, and the front door, although seldom
used, opened from it, showing a little garden
in which grew boys’ love, larkspur,
balsams, and, later in the season, marigolds.
</p>
<p>
But the front room and the front door
were never used; and the little path from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
the door-stone to the flower beds was
overgrown with weeds, years ago. The
side door which led to the barn, the well,
and the woodpile was the proper one to
use. So Randy did not open the door; it
never occurred to her to do so; but she
drew up the green paper curtains, and let
in the sunlight, and, although the room
was scrupulously clean, she decided that
the correct thing to do first was to dust.
</p>
<p>
Between the front windows stood a little
table with an oil-cloth cover, dotted with
red and green figures. Over the table, and
quite too high for any one to take a peep,
hung a small, square looking-glass with a
broad, wooden frame.
</p>
<p>
Randy remembered having seen a huge
asparagus plume over a mirror in the parson’s
sitting room on one gala occasion
when the sewing-circle had met there, and
she had been permitted to be present with
her mother. Asparagus, then, would be
quite the thing with which to decorate
the glass. The parson’s mirror had a gilt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
frame and a gorgeous landscape above the
glass, and Randy felt sure that the wooden
frame needed the decoration even more than
the gilt one. The asparagus in place, Randy
stopped in the middle of the floor, duster in
hand, to view the effect. Her eyes wandered
about the room, and this is what she
saw.
</p>
<p>
On the opposite wall was a picture entitled
“The Tree of Life,” on which every
known virtue hung pendant from the
branches on one side, while every evil of
which man is guilty kept the balance on
the other.
</p>
<p>
This picture always served to depress
Randy. The tree was a sombre green,
and Randy espied Envy printed in large
type on that side where hung the sins,
and she felt sure that a wee bit of envy
had crept into her heart on Sunday, and as
she looked at the pictured tree she said,
under her breath: “Must have been vanity
that made me almost hate my sunbonnet.
The parson preached a while ago on the
sin of vanity.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
Poor Randy! To think it a sin to long
with all her girlish heart for pretty things!
With a sigh she turned from the picture of
the tree to the one hanging upon the side
wall. This was more cheerful—an ancient
fashion plate in which insipid-looking
gentlemen, in white trousers and long,
blue coats, were smiling at some waxen-faced
ladies whose beruffled skirts were
voluminously extended.
</p>
<p>
She rather admired this picture, mainly
because the people in it, at least, looked
cheerful. Leaving the pictures, Randy let
her eyes slowly wander over the furnishings.
As none of her neighbors or acquaintances
had carpets, the yellow painted floor
seemed quite fine. The chairs were also
yellow, and as a crowning luxury, a green
enamelled cloth lounge stood in all its slippery
grandeur against the wall, beside the
door.
</p>
<p>
Randy liked the lounge, but wished it possible
to sit upon it without slipping. While
she was wishing that she had some pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
thing in the shape of an ornament for the
table, her eyes wandered to the window,
where, looking out into the garden, she
could see the tall spikes of pink and blue
larkspur waving in the breeze. A bright
idea! Why not have some flowers upon
the table?
</p>
<p>
Away she ran to the kitchen closet, and
there she inspected everything on the shelves,
so anxious was she to find something fine
for her flowers.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s the thing,” said Randy, “if
mother’ll let me have it.” Appealed to,
Mrs. Weston looked doubtful. “’Tain’t a
vase,” said she, “it’s my old white and blue
spoon holder, an’ I do’no how it will look in
the best room.”
</p>
<p>
“But you’d be willing I should use it,
wouldn’t you?” Randy asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t mind your usin’ it; go put
your posies in it an’ see how it looks.”
</p>
<p>
Surprised and delighted that her mother
should express the least interest, Randy
skipped out into the garden and came running back in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
a few moments with a dozen
long stalks of larkspur in her hands. She
filled the old spoon holder with water and
crowded in the flowers, then away she ran
to the best room.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother,” she called, a minute later,
“do come and see the room.” Mrs. Weston
stopped in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I do declare,” she ejaculated, “I
must say that does look pretty. Why,
Randy, you do have a real knack to fix it
up so. Them flowers brighten up the place
wonderful, and that sparrowgrass just beats
anything.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad you like it, mother!
Would you put some on the mantel if you
were me?”
</p>
<p>
“I’d put some anywhere,” said her
mother, wiping her eyes with the corner of
her apron. “I declare I’d actually forgotten
how much the blossoms cheer up the
house. I used to bring them in when I
was first married, but ever sence I’ve been
too busy to think of anything but cookin’,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
sweepin’, sewin’, and mendin’ from Monday
’til Saturday; but, Randy, if you’re a mind
to, you may bring in a few blossoms once
in a while. It seems like the time when I
used to fix up the house, and myself too,
for that matter.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston was a reserved woman, and
Randy was amazed that her mother should
show so much feeling, and delighted that
her efforts at decoration were approved.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I had something to hang down
from the mantel in some way. I don’t
know how to say it, but I know just how
it ought to look.” A moment Randy stood
thinking with a queer little scowl over her
eyes. Then her face brightened, and out
of the room she darted, then across the
yard to the old well around whose sides the
wild morning glory clambered. Lifting her
skirt, she filled it with the long vines and
hurried back to the house.
</p>
<p>
She filled a small stone jar with water,
carried it to the front room and stood it in
the centre of the mantel, and then proceeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
to fill it with long sprays of the morning
glory. When all the vines were thus disposed
of, she inspected her work.
</p>
<p>
“There, you couldn’t have done better,”
said her mother, and Randy felt rewarded
for her efforts. Then they turned to go
back to the kitchen, and there, in the doorway,
stood Helen Dayton. Randy started.
</p>
<p>
“Forgive me for startling you, and also
for coming in without knocking. I was
out for a walk, and coming up the hill I
thought of your invitation. I walked
toward the house and was about to knock
when this little puss offered to lead me
through the house to you.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure you’re welcome any time, Miss
Dayton, and this girl of mine,” laying her
hand on Randy’s arm, “has been so eager
to see you again I do’no what would have
become of her if you had waited long to
come.”
</p>
<p>
Randy blushed, and Helen Dayton laughed
and said that she was very glad to be so
welcome. Then she chatted pleasantly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
with Mrs. Weston “just as if she had
always known her,” as Randy afterward
said.
</p>
<p>
While she was talking, a little book which
lay upon Miss Dayton’s lap fell to the floor
and flew open, showing a page of bright
little sketches, and Randy and Prue stared
at it in wonder. “My sketch book,” said
Miss Dayton. “I am not an artist, but I
have a bit of talent and have studied a
little, and when I go out for a walk I jot
down a part of a birch tree, a few wild
flowers, or some tall weeds beside an old
wall. Take the book and look at it if you
like,” she added, as she caught the eager
look upon Randy’s face.
</p>
<p>
Gladly Randy picked up the little book.
The drawings were not wonderful, only
rather clever, but to the country girl, who
had never seen a sketch, they were truly
charming. Randy looked at each little
picture at least a dozen times, always telling
Prue in a whisper that she must not
put her little fingers on them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
</p>
<p>
“However did you do them?” asked
Randy. “I didn’t know that anybody
ever did such beautiful things.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you for liking them,” said Helen;
“but you must not call them beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” said Randy, “that old mullein
stalk looks just like a mullein, and those
birches look just ’s if you could strip the
bark off.”
</p>
<p>
Helen laughed at Randy’s enthusiasm.
“Sometime, when I come,” said she, “I
will make a sketch of your old well.”
</p>
<p>
“Our well!” said Randy, “would that
look pretty in a picture?” Helen was
amused. “You shall see,” said she; “and
now tell me who arranged the flowers and
vines so prettily?”
</p>
<p>
“I did,” said Randy; “I did it to please
you,” and Randy, the sketch book still in
her hand, looked up into the lovely face.
</p>
<p>
Helen Dayton laid a gentle hand on
Randy’s shoulder, saying sweetly, “Thank
you so much, but tell me why you so
wished to please me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“Because you are the very loveliest girl
I ever saw in this world,” and then Randy
blushed and looked down to cover her confusion.
</p>
<p>
“And because you are the princess,”
chimed in Prue, who had been still an
unusually long time.
</p>
<p>
“The princess!” echoed Helen. “Whatever
do you mean, dear? I am not a
princess,” and Randy hastened to explain.
She told all about the fairy book, and how
on Sunday in church little Prue had felt
sure that Miss Dayton was the princess of
the fairy tales.
</p>
<p>
“Well, of all things!” said Helen; “now
I must assure you, little one, that I am not
a princess, only Helen Dayton of Boston.”
</p>
<p>
“But you look like one,” persisted the
child, looking at her with round, admiring
eyes. Mrs. Weston had slipped from the
room, while the children entertained their
visitor, and as she bustled about the
kitchen, doing many things, she murmured
softly to herself, “Randy’s right, the girl
<em>is</em> lovely.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
A pretty picture they made—the young
girl and the two children—as they sat in
the best room, chatting now like old
acquaintances. Helen had taken little
Prue upon her lap, where she sat looking
admiringly up into that young lady’s face,
while Randy sat beside her on the floor,
telling her all her small confidences.
</p>
<p>
“Randy’s such a homely name,” she was
saying. “’Tain’t so bad as Jerushy, but
it’s homely enough.”
</p>
<p>
“But that isn’t the whole name, is it?
Isn’t it ‘Miranda’?” asked Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” said Randy, “and it sounds
almost fine when you say it; but, generally,
it’s just Randy. And there’s Prue.
Her name is Prudence, after Aunt Prudence.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s just horrid,” said Prue, so vehemently
that Helen and Randy laughed.
After a pause Randy asked, abruptly, “If
you belong in Boston, how could you come
here to board; Boston’s a city, my geography
says so, and this is just country.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is just why I came here,” said
Helen. “The spring found me very tired,
after a long, gay winter, and I came here
to be quiet, and get rested.”
</p>
<p>
“How funny!” said Randy. “I was
wishing and wishing the other day that
it wasn’t always so quiet here, and the
other night when father was talking to
Jason Meade about buying the big piece
of meadow land, Mr. Meade was saying
that he was going to Boston for a spell—he’s
been there once—and he told about
the streets full of people, and cars running
all day, and teams and everything; and
I did wish things would fly around here
awhile.”
</p>
<p>
Randy paused for breath, and looking at
the pretty, eager face, Helen stooped, and
touching the curly head ever so lightly
with her lips she said, “Dear Randy, I’ll
try to stir things up a bit, and we will see
if we cannot have some pleasant times
while I am here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will you?” said Randy, eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
“I never went anywhere ’cept to a sewing-circle
once.”
</p>
<p>
“What will you do?” asked Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you shall see,” said Helen, laughingly.
“We are planning a picnic now,”
said she, “and if we really have it, I’ll
invite you, and you shall go with me.”
</p>
<p>
“With you!” said Randy. “I’d love to,
but I shouldn’t look fit,” and she looked
admiringly at Helen Dayton’s dainty outing
suit, and glanced up at the trim sailor hat
perched upon her pretty head.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you will look every bit fine enough
with a shade hat—we shall all wear broad-brimmed
hats—and a clean gingham dress,”
said Helen, cheerily.
</p>
<p>
“But I’ve got nothing but sunbonnets,”
said Randy, “’less father will buy me one
next time he takes eggs and vegetables to
the village. I mean to ask him to if that
would be soon enough,” and she looked up
eagerly at Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, indeed,” said Helen, “we’ve
planned to have it in about two weeks.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“I want to go, too,” said little Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, dear, so you shall,” said
Helen, “and now I must be going, but I’ll
tell you all about the picnic the next time
we meet. Do you know where Mrs. Gray
lives, Randy?”
</p>
<p>
Randy laughed. “Of course I do,” said
she.
</p>
<p>
“Well, when father brings home your
new shade hat, and of course he will, if you
wish it so much, suppose you take a walk
over to Mrs. Gray’s and make a little call
upon me, and when you come bring the
new hat with you; I shouldn’t wonder if I
had something with which to trim it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I will, I will!” said Randy,
eagerly, “and then you’ll tell me all
about the picnic.”
</p>
<p>
With sheer excitement little Prue was executing
a funny little jig, which reminded
Helen to inquire for the injured foot.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all well. See!” and Prue hopped
upon that one foot to assure her that it was
quite itself again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“I should call that foot very well indeed,”
said Helen. Then together they
walked out to the kitchen where, bidding
good morning to Mrs. Weston, Helen said
that she had enjoyed her call, admired
Randy’s tasteful decoration, and asked if
she might borrow Randy once in a while.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, you may have Randy whenever
I can spare her,” said Mrs. Weston,
“’though she seems so took up with you,
and so delighted, that when she comes
home from a call on you I’m afraid she’ll
about tread on air.”
</p>
<p>
Helen laughed, and taking Randy’s hand
they walked together as far as the road where
Randy, perched upon the wall, watched her
new friend out of sight.
</p>
<p>
Helen turned many times to wave her
hand until a bend in the road hid her from
view. Then Randy walked slowly to the
house, followed by Prue, and as they walked
they talked of nothing but Helen’s beauty
and sweetness and the wonderful picnic.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—THE PICNIC</h2>
<p>
Mr. Weston had gone to market two
days after Helen Dayton’s call upon Randy.
He had laughed heartily at the description
of the exact kind of shade hat which Randy
wished for, and as he drove off he continued
to laugh as Mrs. Weston called after him,
“Remember, she wants a white hat; don’t,
for mercy’s sake, come home with a brown
one.”
</p>
<p>
“And, father,” shrieked Randy, “remember
to get a big one and one that isn’t too
coarse.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, land sakes! I b’lieve I’ll bring
ye home a dozen to pick from,” and the
good man chuckled to himself—he had
his own plan for doing Randy’s errand.
His eggs and vegetables disposed of, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
turned to start for home, when he ejaculated,
“Bless me! if I didn’t most forgit
Randy’s hat.” Back into the store he
went. “What have ye got for hats?”
said Mr. Weston. “My Randy’s set her
mind on havin’ a fine shade hat for the
picnic, and nothin’ but a white one will
do.”
</p>
<p>
Silas Barnes reached under his counter
and brought forth a dozen straw hats,
which lie spread out for Mr. Weston to
select from.
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, that beats all! Randy and her
mother told me just how it ought to look,
but I don’t see any difference in ’em, do
you, Barnes?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” replied the genial storekeeper,
“that one’s twice as fine as the
other, an’ it’s worth twice as much.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I guess it’s ’bout good enough
for Randy, then, and I’ll take it.”
</p>
<p>
When her father returned that night
Randy met him at the door, and with a
little cry of delight took the parcel which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
he handed her, and she could not find
words to express her pleasure when the
fresh, white hat lay before her on the
table.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! Ye might have had one
before, if it delights ye so,” said her
mother; “I didn’t think of it before,
because most every girl here wears a
sunbonnet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ve got it now,” said Randy,
“and to-morrow I’ll go over to Miss Dayton’s
and she’ll trim it for me; she said
she would.” On the following day, true
to her promise, Helen gave Randy a cordial
welcome, and trimmed the hat with
some gay ribbons which, although not
new, were very pretty, and to Randy
seemed nothing short of gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
On the day of the picnic no happier
heart than Randy Weston’s beat fast with
anticipation; and with Prue’s hand held
tightly in her own she started, as they
had planned, for Mrs. Gray’s house to join
Helen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t forget to take care of Prue,”
called her mother.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t forget,” answered Randy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston stepped back into the house
after watching the children until a bend
in the road concealed them from view,
and sat down for a moment before going
out to the field. “I tell ye what, mother,”
said he, “I mean those girls shall have a
chance. I’d no idee what a difference
there was between a hat and a sunbunnit.
I say, why don’t you have a new
bunnit yourself, mother? You were every
bit as pretty as our Randy when you were
young, and I b’lieve you’d look a good deal
the same now, with a little fixin’. Just see
the difference in Randy with a bran’ new
hat! When we was a-payin’ off the mortgage
we had to scrimp; but now, I think
ye might have a few duds, once in a while.”
</p>
<p>
He stopped, expecting a rebuff, and was
surprised when his wife turned with a
sweet smile and said, “I b’lieve I will
have just a few things.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ye can have what ye want,” was the
hearty rejoinder, “and we’ll go to the village
next week and do some shoppin’,”
and with a jolly whistle he started for the
barn.
</p>
<p>
When they arrived at Mrs. Gray’s, the
children were surprised to find almost every
man, woman, and child who had been invited
to the picnic already there, and, as
they were all talking at once, it was impossible
to understand what any one person
was saying.
</p>
<p>
Very conscious of her new hat was
Randy, and she longed to find Helen that
she might talk with her. She knew that
any one with whom she stopped to speak
would mention her new finery, so she only
nodded pleasantly to the girls whom she
passed, and walked toward the house, hoping
there to find Helen. Helen saw her
and came out to meet her; but as Randy
passed the Babson girls, she heard Phœbe
Small say to them: “Look at Randy
Weston! Isn’t she getting fine!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Dunno how fine she is,” responded Belinda
Babson; “but I don’t see as she need
walk right by us, just because she’s got a
new hat.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Randy! She had not the least idea
of being vain or silly. “Why need the
girls spoil the fun of my having a new hat,”
said she, and a hot flush crept up on her
cheek, but soon Helen’s merry chatter
caused Randy to forget Phœbe’s unkindness,
and she was laughing and talking as
gayly as Helen herself.
</p>
<p>
Miss Dobbs, the little soprano of the
choir, hearing Randy’s laugh, turned and
smiled, an unusual thing for her to do, saying:
“How are ye, Randy? That’s a dreadful
pretty hat.”
</p>
<p>
“I like it,” said Randy, simply, although
her eyes showed her delight that some one
should approve of it. “Miss Dayton
trimmed it for me; didn’t she do it lovely?”
continued Randy, anxious that her new
friend should have all the glory which belonged
to her for her millinery skill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“Umph!” ejaculated Miss Dobbs, “they
do say you’re pretty int’mit with Miss Dayton,
considering she’s from the city.”
Randy moved away, pleased with the compliment
for her hat, but hurt by the last
remark. “‘Considering she’s from the
city,’” thought Randy. “Anybody’d think
I asked her to be pleasant to me. Why, I
wouldn’t have dared to. She wanted to be
nice, and I was glad enough to let her,” and
she brushed away a tear and forced back a
sob which rose in her throat.
</p>
<p>
Just then something happened to cheer
Randy and give her a wee bit of triumph.
</p>
<p>
Phœbe Small moved toward Randy and
fastening her small eyes disapprovingly
upon the offending hat, she was about to
speak, when, without noticing Phœbe at all,
Jotham Potts walked awkwardly up to
Randy, and, standing upon one foot, then
shifting to the other, he said: “Morning,
Randy! Be you going to walk to the picnic
or ride? Because,” he continued, “I
told father I’d like to have you ride with us,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
seein’s we have a spare seat, and he said
he’d be pleased to have your company.
Will ye come, Randy? I do wish ye
would.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to, and thank you,” answered
Randy, sweetly, with a blush and a glance
at Phœbe Small, who pretended not to have
heard, “but I promised to go in Mr. Gray’s
team with Miss Dayton, so I’ll have to.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish ye was goin’ with us, but as
ye can’t, I’ll see ye at the picnic,” said
Jotham, and he turned to get into his
father’s wagon; then, stepping back to
where Randy was standing, he blushed, and
from his pocket produced a little package.
</p>
<p>
“Here, Randy,” he said, “I brought this
a purpose for you to enjoy durin’ the ride,
so I guess I’ll give it to ye now.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you,” said Randy, “how
good you are,” and that so completely overcame
Jotham that he retired in confusion.
By this time the party was about ready to
start. The choir had decided to go in the
first wagon and enliven the way by singing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
and were still discussing as to a selection
from their scant repertoire.
</p>
<p>
“Ye needn’t ask me to join ye,” said
Silas Barnes, “and sing ‘Chany,’”—he
meant China—“for I don’t think that’s
gay enough for a picnic.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Hobson suggested that they might
please Mr. Barnes by singing “Yankee
Doodle.” This was meant to suggest that
Silas Barnes was too frivolous, but he did
not, apparently, feel injured, as he laughingly
answered that he would “rather be
patriotic than mournful, and he reely
guessed they’d better settle upon ‘Yankee
Doodle,’ as Miss Hobson suggested.”
</p>
<p>
On one end of the door-stone old Mrs.
Perkins had just convinced her neighbor,
Mrs. Johnson, that it was just the right time
of the year to gather ‘pennyroyal’ and
mouse-ear, and so have them a-drying, and
Mrs. Buffum had gathered the six little
Buffums under her wing by uttering this
awful threat:—
</p>
<p>
“Johnny! Johnny Buffum! do you and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
Hitty want to go to the picnic? Katie!
do you and Jack and Sophy and Ann want
to stay at home? Well, then, come here,
or the first thing you’ll know the wagons’ll
go without ye!”
</p>
<p>
From all directions the six young Buffums
rushed and crowded closely around
their mother. Stay at home from their
first picnic? Never!
</p>
<p>
At last every one had arrived, and they
lost no time in clambering into the waiting
wagons; then away they jogged
toward the grove.
</p>
<p>
Farmer Gray had taken his wife and
Helen Dayton, Randy and little Prue in
one wagon, and had told his other boarders
that they were welcome to fill his two
remaining wagons, allotting places as they
chose.
</p>
<p>
The wagon with the choir had started
first, and Randy and Helen could still
faintly hear the stirring strains of “Yankee
Doodle.” Randy sat with sparkling
eyes, enjoying the ride as she had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
enjoyed one before. Had she not a fine
new hat? Was she not beside the beautiful
Miss Dayton? and had not Jotham, to
the envy of the other girls, given her a
package purchased expressly for her?
</p>
<p>
“What you got in your bundle what
Jotham gave you, Randy?” asked Prue.
“Will you let me see?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, do let us see,” said Helen Dayton;
“I know it must be something nice.”
</p>
<p>
So Randy untied the package and found
a lot of huge pink and white peppermints,
which Prue at once commenced to help
her eat. Helen pronounced them to be
very nice, but as she never liked peppermints,
politely excused herself from eating
them by saying that she must save her
appetite for the spread at the picnic.
</p>
<p>
Along the dusty road they jogged, Randy
never minding the heat, Helen feeling it
intensely, even with the protection of her
dainty ruffled parasol. Sometimes they
rode under overhanging boughs which
made long, cool shadows across the road,
then over a sunny, dusty stretch with only
a fringe of daisies by the roadside and a
chain of hazy blue hills in the distance.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>
The occupants of one wagon would chat
merrily with those in the wagon behind
them; and so, with sunny and shady roads,
with laughter and song, they at last reached
the grove.
</p>
<p>
The horses were unharnessed and tethered
with a rope long enough to permit
them to graze. The baskets of lunch were
all placed in one large wagon which stood
in the shade of a huge tree. Then intimate
friends and neighbors formed little groups
and sat under the trees and chatted together,
delighted to have this little outing.
The children played hide-and-seek behind
the tree trunks, and those farmers who had
left their work to enjoy the holiday talked
over their crops, their cattle, and the price of
produce when disposed of at the village store.
</p>
<p>
The Babson girls were each trying in an
awkward fashion to win favor in the eyes
of Reuben Jenks, who Phœbe Small declared “had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
hull basketful of maple
sugar stored away under the seat of his
father’s wagon.”
</p>
<p>
When Reuben had spoken of the picnic
his mother, who was, to express it mildly,
a frugal woman, had said that she, for one,
didn’t approve of picnics. “Folks eat four
times as much at a picnic as they do at
home, and ain’t no better satisfied,” she
declared; but after much urging she consented
to go, saying: “A lot of maple
sugar’ll be all I’ll take. Sweets take
away folks’ appetites, and folks that eat
my maple sugar won’t want much else.”
</p>
<p>
But try as they would, neither Belinda’s
nor Jemima’s blandishments brought forward
any of the desired sugar. Now Reuben
liked the girls well enough, and his
boyish vanity was pleased by their evident
liking for his society. He was a generous
little fellow and would gladly have treated
his friends, but his mother’s eyes were upon
him, and he said afterward, he “just didn’t
dare.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
Jotham Potts, hearing Helen say that
she liked water cresses, gallantly offered
to go and find some, assuring her that he
knew just where they grew.
</p>
<p>
Helen, Randy, and Prue sat under a
large tree, and Helen promised, since
Randy was so charmed with fairy tales,
to tell some which she knew they had
never heard. She told them tales from
Grimm’s wonderful book, pleasantly answering
Prue’s funny questions regarding
them. When she related the story of the
“Gold Children,” little Prue’s eyes dilated
with wonder.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just beautiful,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“If they were clear, solid gold how could
they move or stir?” asked Prue.
</p>
<p>
Helen laughed, and patted the little girl’s
cheek as she said: “Dear little girl, you
mustn’t ask questions which have no answers.
Remember the fairy tales are not
true, only amusing.”
</p>
<p>
Having told story after story, Helen
became a bit weary, and she proposed that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
the children should gather a few flowers,
saying that she would twine them into a
lovely wreath for Prue’s curly head.
</p>
<p>
Off went the children to search for the
finest blossoms to heap in Helen’s lap.
Soon little Prue hastened back with three
large daisies and a buttercup, asking if they
were quite enough to make a wreath.
“No, indeed,” said Helen, “I must have
ever so many more.”
</p>
<p>
Away ran Prue, shouting to the children,
“Miss Dayton says it takes a nawful lot
more.” Soon other children came running
to Helen with little hands full of buttercups
and daisies, until she cried, “Enough, more
than enough!” and commenced the weaving
of the wreath.
</p>
<p>
The children watched her dainty fingers,
as with airy grace they fashioned it, and
when she twined the ends of the garland together,
and placed the finished wreath upon
Prue’s head, their delight knew no bounds.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Dayton, you can do anything,
can’t you?” said Belinda Babson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, indeed!” said Helen, “there
are many, many things which I cannot do.”
</p>
<p>
Then they spread the table-cloth upon
the grass, and “put the picnic on it,” as Prue
said. Prue’s idea of a picnic was a lunch
out of doors, and until the luncheon made
its appearance, she felt that the picnic had
not even commenced. Then suddenly clapping
her chubby hands, and dancing in a
manner which threatened to dislodge her
flower crown, she said, “May I wear this
wreath while I eat my lunch?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do,” said Helen, “it is really very
becoming.”
</p>
<p>
Every one seemed anxious that Helen
should sit as guest of honor at the spread,
so, with children on either side, she took
her place, and deftly put each one present
at ease with her bright, pleasant conversation;
now saying a kind word to old Mrs.
Dewing, that she might not feel neglected, or
laughing lightly at Farmer Morse’s clumsy
wit, noticing Randy’s gentle manner with
her little sister, and at the same time, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
ready tact, seeming unmindful of the practised
hand with which Jack Marden handled
his pie with his knife.
</p>
<p>
So with laughter and gay chatter the
lunch was eaten and cleared away, and
some one proposed some games.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s play ‘On the green carpet,’” said
Phœbe Small, and a chorus of voices echoed:
“Oh, yes! Let’s play that first;” so, joining
hands, they sang the old tune as they
danced about Helen, whom they insisted
should first stand in the centre.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And&nbsp;&nbsp;choose&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;best,”<br />
</p>
<p>
sang the children.
</p>
<p>
“I choose Randy,” said Helen, much to
Randy’s delight.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Give&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;kiss&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;send&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;tell&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;you’ll&nbsp;&nbsp;call&nbsp;&nbsp;another&nbsp;&nbsp;day,”<br />
</p>
<p>
sang the gay little troop, and Helen stooped,
and taking Randy’s sweet face between her
hands she kissed her and slipped from the
ring. Around and about Randy they circled, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
she must choose. She longed
to choose Helen, and turned toward her, but
Helen said, “We must not keep choosing
each other, Randy, because it is more fun
to change about,” so Randy turned with a
puzzled face, wondering whom to choose.
Seeing the little sister’s eager face, she
decided at once. “I choose you, pussy,”
said she.
</p>
<p>
Into the ring sprang Prue. “Oh, Randy,”
said the child, “you did love me best, didn’t
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Randy; “but now we
know, Prue, that you love me best, you
choose the one you love next best, because
that’s the way to play it;” so, wondering
much whom the child would favor, Randy
left her in the circle. But it did not take
dear little Prue a great while to decide.
</p>
<p>
“Next to Randy, I guess I like you,
Jotham, so I choose you,” said the child.
Every one laughed except Jotham, who,
seeing the little girl’s lip quiver, said awkwardly,
yet very kindly, “You’re a nice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
little girl, Prue, and I’m real proud to have
you choose me;” at which Prue’s spirits
rose, and, turning with one little hand in
Jotham’s, she said: “You needn’t have
laughed if I did choose a big boy. He’s
very nice, and ’most always gives Randy
candy, and she gives some to me.”
</p>
<p>
This so amused every one that they commenced
to pet Prue, and, much to Jotham’s
delight, the game ended, for he felt that he
could have chosen none but Randy as his
favorite among his friends, and he realized
that this would have been a trying ordeal
for his diffidence.
</p>
<p>
Many games they played that sunny
afternoon, and so fast flew the hours that
every one was surprised when Deacon Turnbull
pulled out his great, old-fashioned
“timepiece” and declared that it “wanted
a quarter to six, and that they ought to be
hitchin’ up and startin’ toward home.”
</p>
<p>
So the baskets and pails were packed
into the wagons, the horses harnessed, and
the merry, tired party started homeward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
Some of the picnickers were jolly, singing
as they went along, others were too tired
to sing; but all were unanimous in voting
the picnic a success, many declaring that
it was just wonderful how Miss Dayton
planned it, and that they didn’t know when
they’d had such a good time. The ride
with Helen was delightful to the two children,
Randy looking admiringly at Helen
all the way and talking little. She was
really too happy for conversation.
</p>
<p>
Not so with little Prue. She sat between
Helen and Randy, and all the way home
her chatter was interspersed with snatches
of the songs which had been a part of their
games.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘On&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;green&nbsp;&nbsp;carpet&nbsp;&nbsp;here&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take&nbsp;&nbsp;your&nbsp;&nbsp;true&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;kiss&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;send&nbsp;&nbsp;her&nbsp;&nbsp;away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;tell&nbsp;&nbsp;her—’<br />
</p>
<p>
“That’s just the best picnic I ever saw, wasn’t
it, Randy?”
</p>
<p>
Before Randy could answer, out rang the
childish treble again:—
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Sailor&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;er&nbsp;&nbsp;boat&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;tide&nbsp;&nbsp;runs&nbsp;&nbsp;high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;er&nbsp;&nbsp;boat&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;tide&nbsp;&nbsp;runs&nbsp;&nbsp;high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailor&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;er&nbsp;&nbsp;boat&nbsp;&nbsp;when&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;tide&nbsp;&nbsp;runs&nbsp;&nbsp;high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;girl&nbsp;&nbsp;to—’<br />
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Miss Dayton, don’t you think Jotham’s
’most as nice as a prince? I do,” said Prue,
without waiting for an answer, although she
looked up in Miss Dayton’s face expectantly.
</p>
<p>
Helen took Prue’s little dimpled hand in
her own as she said: “All princes are not
good, although many of them are very, very
good indeed. Jotham has a good face, and
I am sure when I really know him I shall
like him very much. If he grows to be a
good, brave, true man, that is worth much
more than being a prince.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m,” said Prue, not quite catching
Helen’s meaning, yet vaguely understanding
that Jotham was fully appreciated.
Prue’s curly head swayed a little, like a
tired flower; and Helen, slipping her arm
around her, drew her toward her, and soon
the little girl’s head lay against her new
friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
Still she sang, although drowsily:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;&nbsp;choice&nbsp;&nbsp;you’ve&nbsp;&nbsp;made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;wish&nbsp;&nbsp;you’d&nbsp;&nbsp;longer&nbsp;&nbsp;stayed?’”<br />
</p>
<p>
The last line was drawled out so slowly that
Randy said, “Oh, wake up, Prue, you’re
asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I ain’t sleepy, but my eyes feel
’s if—” she was now really asleep just as
they reached Farmer Gray’s door.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston was waiting in the dooryard
with his own team to take the children
home, and, after an exchange of remarks
with Mr. Gray regarding the weather and
bluff, but hearty thanks to Miss Dayton for
the children’s day of pleasure, he took little
Prue in his arms, and, placing her in
Randy’s lap, gathered up the reins, and
with a resounding “g’lang there” the old
mare ambled toward home.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston was at the door when they
arrived. “Well, Randy,” said she, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>Oh</span>, mother!” cried Randy, “it was
just splendid, and we had such good times
all day.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“What! Prue asleep?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said little Prue, “I ain’t asleep,
but my eyes feel funny, and we had gingerbread
and peppermints, and cold sausage
and lemonade, and ‘On the—green—carpet,’
and I chose Jotham, and I had a wreath
and some maple sugar, and it was all made
of daisies and butter—cups—and—and,”
but here she lost the thread of her story,
and was carried upstairs and put in her
bed.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—RANDY OUTWITS JASON MEADE</h2>
<p>
The day after the picnic was a busy one
for Mrs. Weston, and Randy, eager to be
helpful, was really a fine assistant. She
washed all the dishes, allowing little Prue
to wipe the spoons, knives, and forks because
they would not break if dropped, then she
thoroughly cleansed the milk cans and put
them just outside the door to dry in the
bright sunlight.
</p>
<p>
“Now, mother, what do you suppose I’m
going to do next?” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said her mother, “but
ye have worked this morning like all
possessed.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Randy, “I’m just going to
bring in towels and aprons from the line
and sprinkle and iron them, so’s you can
sit down awhile after dinner.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston looked at the bright, flushed
face a moment, then said: “I do declare,
Randy, you’re a real help. There ain’t a
better daughter in this town, if I do say it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mother,” said Randy, “I’d ’most
work my fingers off just to hear you say
that. I help you because I love you, though
somehow I never ’til now could say it.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston wiped her eyes with a corner
of her apron, then, turning to Randy, she
kissed her, saying: “Why, Randy, it does
me good to hear you say it, and, child, ye
must know I’m all bound up in you and
Prue. We busy folks sometimes forget to
show how much we really feel.”
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” said Randy, “to make you
and father happy, always; sometimes I
forget to help, but always I mean to.”
</p>
<p>
“I know ye do,” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
Randy moved about the kitchen with a
subtle sense of exhilaration. Her mother
had always been kind and good, but to have
her speak of her affection and say a word
of approval for her helpfulness, what more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
could be needed to make a young girl happy?
thought Randy.
</p>
<p>
She sang little snatches of melody while
she cleared the dinner table, and grasped
the first leisure moment to steal out under
the apple tree, thence toward the brook
to the old stone wall. A large stone had
toppled from the wall, and Randy sat down
upon it to rest. She had intended to make
a little call upon Miss Dayton, to talk over
the events of the picnic, and to hear what
her new friend had to tell her; for Helen
had hinted that she had another good time
planned, and she promised to tell Randy all
about it when next they met.
</p>
<p>
Tall alders grew luxuriantly almost the
entire length of the wall, which served as
a fence for one side of the pasture; and
Randy, a bit tired with the forenoon’s work,
easily fell into one of her day-dreams,
when she was aroused by hearing voices
behind the alders. There seemed to be two
voices, and Randy heard them mention her
father’s name. She was an honest girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
who, under ordinary circumstances, would
have scorned to listen; but something in
the tone of the speaker’s voice seemed distinctly
unfriendly when he spoke of her
father, and Randy seemed, against her will,
riveted to the spot and obliged to listen.
She must have taken her place on the big
stone when the conversation was well under
way, but the sound of her own footsteps,
while unheard by the earnest talkers, had
prevented her from hearing their voices.
She was invisible to them as they were to
her, separated as they were by the alders.
</p>
<p>
“Now, I’ve tried and tried ’til I’m tired
er tryin’ to sell Mr. Weston that piece er
medder land er mine, ’n’ it would a been
sold long ago if I hadn’t been bound to
swap land instead er taking cash.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I don’t see the great pint er
not takin’ cash ef he’s fool enough to pay
it,” said the second voice.
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<div><a name='f115' id='f115'></a></div>

<img src="images/illus-115.jpg" alt="“Nearer to the Wall she crept”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“Nearer to the Wall she crept”</span>
</div>
<p>
“I don’t s’pose ye do, ’til I tell ye. Ye
haven’t been here fer years, ’n’ only come
yisterday, an’ ef you was anybody under the
sun but my own brother, I wouldn’t tell ye
now.”
</p>
<p>
How Randy’s heart beat! Surely, it was
right to listen now. If any one meant to
do her father harm, she must know it and
warn him. Nearer to the wall she crept,
with a stealth which she was unaware she
possessed, and she tried to hush her breathing
which came quick and hard.
</p>
<p>
“Just listen to this, Jim. My wife’s just
got back from a visit to her folks, I forgit
the name of the town, ’though it’s on my
tongue’s end this minute, and while she was
there she heard say that they’re goin’ to
run a railroad through this part of the
town, next summer, jest a sort er branch
road from the one that goes through the
centre, and my wife never let on that she
was much interested; but she asked ’nough
questions, kinder keerful like, and she found
that ef they <em>do</em> build the road, and she says
the folks down that way say they do really
mean to, it’ll be straight across that little
bit er rocky field, back er Weston’s barn.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
Now, I argy that Weston’s got money
<em>’nough</em>, and I mean ter keep at him ’til he
agrees ter swap that ’ere little pesky, rocky
field er his’n fer my piece er medder land.
The more I urge him the less he seems ter
want ter swap, an’ I even offered to throw
in a good young steer to boot, an’ all the
satisfaction I could git out er him was,
‘Wal’, I dunno what makes yer so anxious
fer that little piece er land er mine.’
</p>
<p>
“He don’t know nothin’ ’bout the railroad
yet, but there’s no knowin’ how soon
he will. My wife’s naggin’ me to make
him swap, but I’d like to see her try to
hurry Weston when he don’t intend to
hurry; but I tell ye now, ef that ’ere road
<em>does</em> run through his field, I mean ter own
it <em>fust</em>, an’ I’m goin’ up ter night ter talk
him inter it.”
</p>
<p>
Randy now realized that the speaker’s
voice was no other than Jason Meade’s.
She was but fifteen, but she knew that if
her father yielded to his neighbor’s urging,
it would in some way mean loss to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
All thought of her call upon Helen vanished,
and in its place lay a great fear that she
might be seen before she could get away
from her hiding place and rush home.
</p>
<p>
She was a bit cramped with her crouching
pose behind the wall. Slowly she
arose to her feet, glided along upon the
grass, lest her footsteps should be heard,
and, once in the grove, she sprang across
the brook, dashed through the fields, up
the path, and into the kitchen door, where
she dropped upon a chair and tried to
speak.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy Weston! whatever ails
ye? Ye look ’s if ye’d seen a ghost. Why,
father,” as the girl did not speak, “jest
come look at Randy. She’s been runnin’
’til she’s clean tuckered out, ’n’ can’t seem
to speak.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston came hastening in from the
well with a pail of water, which he set
down when he saw Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy, child, what—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father,—the little rocky field behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
the barn,—don’t sell it, don’t swap it; the
railroad’s going through it; and oh, father,
that’s why Jason Meade wants to make
you swap it. It’s going to be worth lots
and lots of money; he can’t <em>make</em> you
swap it, can he, father?” and in her
anxiety she sprang up and put her hands
upon her father’s shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“There, there, Randy, you’ve done your
father a good turn this time, sure enough,
ef it’s true. Sit down and tell me where
ye heard all this.”
</p>
<p>
So Randy, having regained her breath,
told her anxious listeners the tale, beginning
with her intended call upon Miss
Dayton; how she strolled through the grove
and across the brook, and sat down to rest
upon the big stone by the wall, with the
great alders behind her; how she had, at
first sound of the voices, tried not to listen,
and, on hearing an unfriendly voice mention
her father’s name, she had, although
afraid of detection, crept close to the wall,
to hear if the men really meant to harm
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
Then she had told all that she had heard,
word for word, finishing with, “And, father,
he <em>can’t</em> make you swap, can he? he seemed
so determined.”
</p>
<p>
Then Mr. Weston did a very unusual
thing. Putting his arm around Randy, he
drew her down upon his knee, where she
had not sat since she was a little girl like
Prue, and as he looked at her, with just a
suspicion of moisture in his kind, blue eyes,
he said, “Mother, we’ve got a girl to be
proud of.”
</p>
<p>
“And to be thankful for,” said Mrs.
Weston.
</p>
<p>
“Amen!” said Randy’s father, and he
added, “Always be as brave and quick to
do what’s right, Randy, as you have been
to-day, even forgetting your own pleasure,
and I will trust you anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
Here little Prue, who had been awed
into silence by the earnestness of the conversation,
found her tongue once more, and
piped in with, “Why, pa, my big sister
Randy’s been good again. How can she be
always good?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
</p>
<p>
They all laughed, and Randy, catching
little Prue and giving her a tight hug, said:
“I know who’s got the best little sister in
all the world. I have, just as sure as your
name is Prudence.”
</p>
<p>
“I like you to love me lots, Randy dear,
but don’t you call me anything but Prue.
‘Prudence’ makes me think of Aunt Prudence,
and she looked all so,” and here
Prue drew down her wee mouth, and puckered
up her fair little forehead and brows
into such a scowling imitation of Aunt
Prudence, that even her father, who did
not at all approve, could not help smiling
at the dimpled copy of that lady’s unpleasant
face.
</p>
<p>
Soon Mrs. Weston had tea ready, and
the family had but just finished the evening
meal when a loud tap at the door
announced some neighbor’s arrival. Mr.
Weston looked at his wife, with a twinkle
in his eye, as he arose to answer the
knock.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well, Jason, come in, come in!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
Thus Mr. Weston welcomed his crafty
neighbor.
</p>
<p>
“How are ye, Square Weston? I thought
I’d jist drop in an’ see if you’d made up
yer mind about that piece er land er
mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, yes, I hev,” said Mr. Weston,
looking his neighbor squarely in the face;
“I told ye, a month ago, I’d give ye two
hundred dollars in cash fer that big medder
of yourn.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it, I know you did; but the
thing is, I’ve took a reel fancy to that little
rocky pasture er yourn, and I feel ’s if I’d
lots rather have it, little as it is, than the
cash, ’f you’ll believe me.”
</p>
<p>
Jason Meade sat back in his chair with
the bland air of a man who had done a
good deed in praising his neighbor’s property.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston came out of the closet where
she had been placing the dishes and stood
by her husband’s chair, anxiously awaiting
his answer. She knew his generous nature,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
but she believed that this time he would be
firm.
</p>
<p>
Randy, who after tea had taken the fairy
book to the table to read, now leaned forward
with parted lips.
</p>
<p>
Slowly Mr. Weston turned toward his
neighbor, and a faint smile played about his
lips as he said, “I’ll tell ye, Jason, I jist
thought that while it ain’t so very val’able
now, I’ve ’bout decided to keep it, for when
the railroad comes clean through it, I’m
thinkin’ I’ll be reel pleased to think it’s my
property.”
</p>
<p>
Jason Meade’s mouth opened to its
widest extent, and to say that he was
amazed, astonished, or surprised, would be
expressing it very mildly indeed. He
cleared his throat and blinked once or twice,
then, as no suitable remark seemed to suggest
itself he arose, and pushing back his
chair, he said “he’d reely have to go as he’d
got an arrant to do at Mrs. Gray’s.” He
sheepishly made his way toward the door,
and mumbling something about the weather,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
he dejectedly stalked out with the air of a
disappointed man.
</p>
<p>
“Why, father,” said Randy, “he didn’t
even ask you how you knew about the
railroad.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston laughed as he said: “I guess
he didn’t care how I knew. That I knew
at all was what worried him.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—TABLEAUX</h2>
<p>
One morning Miss Dayton sent a little
hastily written note to Mrs. Weston, saying
that she was planning another entertainment
which she believed would be as
enjoyable as the picnic had been, and asking
if Randy might come over and help
her make some preparations for the event.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston read the note, then re-read
it to Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, may I go, could you spare me?”
said Randy, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes indeed,” said her mother;
“there is less than usual to do to-day, and
nothing at all after dinner. Fly ’round
and get cleared up, and you can put on
your clean red and white gingham and
your new hat and go over early.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Fly ’round!” Randy did fly, and by
two o’clock she was off down the road,
walking as fast as her feet and her enthusiasm
would take her.
</p>
<p>
What could Miss Dayton be planning,
thought Randy, as she hastened toward the
farm-house where Helen was staying.
</p>
<p>
Helen saw her coming and opened the
door, smiling at Randy’s questioning face,
which expressed a world of interest in
Helen’s scheme, whatever it might be.
</p>
<p>
“Come right in, take off your hat, and
sit down and I will tell you all about my
plan for an evening’s pleasure. You know
I promised when I first met you that I
would try to make this summer just a bit
gay during my stay here. Now I believe
we shall all enjoy an evening of tableaux,”
but here Helen was obliged to pause and
explain just what tableaux were, “and,”
she continued, “I think that any one of
the large girls who attended the picnic,
and a few of the little ones, will make a
very nice set of pictures.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I should think it would be lovely,
but,” Randy added doubtfully, “what could
we wear that would be nice enough for pictures
or tab—”
</p>
<p>
“Tableaux,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, tableaux,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“I will agree to furnish the costumes,”
said Miss Dayton; “they will not have to
be very fine to look extremely pretty in
the frame. Mr. Gray has made me a fine
frame which you and I will cover with
evergreen. Then Mrs. Gray has two
bracket lamps which we will fasten to
the back of the frame to light up the pictures,
and I have a lot of odds and ends of
pretty things in my trunks which will be
sufficiently bright and gay for costumes.
Now let us go at once to the barn and
decorate the frame.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Gray’s man, Roger, had just brought
in an immense load of evergreen. Randy
was all eagerness to help, and together
they worked all the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
When she left for home the frame was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
thickly covered. There was evergreen and
asparagus over the pictures in the “best
room” where they were to exhibit to the
townspeople their tableaux, and Randy
had seen her costume which Helen had
designed.
</p>
<p>
Miss Dayton was an ardent admirer of
Greuze, and she possessed many photographic
reproductions of his paintings.
She also owned a number of photographs
of Sir Joshua Reynold’s portraits of beautiful
women and children, and knowing
the bareness of the walls in the average
New England farm-house, she had brought
these pictures with her to decorate her
room during her stay. She intended to
copy these beautiful pictures in the list of
tableaux which she arranged.
</p>
<p>
Randy was spellbound when she saw the
photographs. “Oh, Miss Dayton,” cried
she, “do you really think any of us will
do?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes indeed,” laughed Helen, “I
have you all selected now. You are to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
be the girl with the broken pitcher in the
painting by Greuze. Would you like to
see your costume?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I should like to,” answered
Randy, excitedly clapping her hands; so
Helen showed her a waist with large,
loose sleeves, a kerchief or scarf, and a
wide ribbon “to tie up her bonny brown
hair.”
</p>
<p>
Randy went home in a fever of excitement.
Think of a girl of fifteen who had
never witnessed an entertainment of any
kind, and you will understand with what
delight she looked forward to an evening
of tableaux in which she would take part.
</p>
<p>
Miss Dayton called upon those girls
who she thought would like to pose for
the tableaux, and every one was invited
to be present.
</p>
<p>
The girls, both large and small, were
delighted, and their elders were quite as
pleased with the promise of an evening’s
enjoyment, and every invitation was enthusiastically
accepted. Mrs. Gray’s attic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
proved a perfect treasure room. She generously
offered the contents of all the old
trunks to Helen, saying, “If you see anything
which you can make use of, I shall
be truly glad.” Mrs. Gray had been a city
girl, and had spent the greater part of her
married life there, and she brought to the
farm-house many trunks containing faded
finery, which, while far too good to be
thrown away, were of but little use in
that small country town. Helen chose
those things which she could best utilize
and carried them down to the front room,
where she deposited them behind an improvised
screen.
</p>
<p>
Randy thought the evening would never
come; so did little Prue, for she, too, was to
be one of the “tab things,” as she called
them. She could not remember the word
“tableaux.”
</p>
<p>
But the evening did arrive, and with it
all the girls whom Helen had drilled for
the proper posing, all of the boys who
were curious to see the girls “fixed up for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
pictures,” as Reuben Jenks had expressed
it, and all of the farmers and their wives,
who were nearly as excited as the young
people.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gray and Helen received the friends
and neighbors as they arrived, showing
them the photographs on the walls and telling
them that the girls, correctly dressed,
would look very much like pictures when
seen in the frame.
</p>
<p>
The frame was in place with a dark
background behind it, and stretching from
either side of the frame to the side walls
of the room were some old brocatelle curtains
which Helen had found in Mrs. Gray’s
attic. These curtained spaces served as
dressing rooms.
</p>
<p>
Besides the tableaux Helen had planned
quite a little programme, and although
much drilling had been necessary, each
performer was perfect in her part.
</p>
<p>
Jotham Potts had, after much urging,
agreed to read the programme, and Helen
had promised to contribute a song, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
piano solo which should be the opening
number.
</p>
<p>
The hum of conversation rose loud and
cheery, and so lively did it become that it
was impossible to hear a completed sentence.
</p>
<p>
“They say your Phœbe’s goin’ to be a
dreadful pretty picture to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s she goin’ to—”
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I dunno, seems Miss Dayton thinks
our Jotham has a good voice, so she asked
him to read the—I forgit what you call it,
but anyhow I guess—”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss Dayton says my hair is
auburn and not red, and she says—”
</p>
<p>
“Why, ef here isn’t Mis’ Weston’s little
Prue!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m, I’m going to be one of the tab
things, and sing a little tune what Miss
Dayton learned—no, taught me,” said the
little girl, very proud to think that she had
remembered the correction.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think she’s real nice to come
up here and plan such good times,” but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
here Helen tapped upon the piano, and the
conversation ceased so abruptly that one
might think that the audience held its
breath.
</p>
<p>
The girls rushed behind the curtains on
either side of the frame, and Jotham Potts,
clearing his throat, read the first number
for the evening.
</p>
<p>
Helen had drilled him in pronouncing
those names which he found difficult, and
very clearly he read,—
</p>
<p>
“Our first number will be a piano solo by
Miss Dayton, entitled, ‘Marche Militaire.’”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Potts nudged his wife, saying, in a
loud whisper, “Our Jotham did that just
like a city feller, didn’t he?” His wife
ejaculated “Sh—,” but she smiled and
nodded, for she was of the same opinion.
</p>
<p>
Helen in her white muslin looked very
beautiful, as she took her seat at the piano.
That piano was the only one in town, and
the only one that many of the audience had
ever heard. Helen was a good musician,
and the piece, grand in itself, rang out brilliantly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
to the great delight of every one
present, and many were the words of praise
which reached her ears when she arose.
One voice, bolder than the others, said,
“That’s what I call great; just one more
piece, Miss Dayton, ef it ain’t asking too
much.”
</p>
<p>
This was an honest if unceremonious
encore, so Helen seated herself once more,
and for those simple country people played
a brilliant polacca.
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, ’twas all I could do to keep from
dancin’, I dew declare,” said old Deacon
Turnbull, which made every one laugh, as
the deacon was a very dignified old man.
</p>
<p>
Helen rose and saying, “Now, Jotham,”
she stepped behind the curtains. “Our
next number,” announced Jotham, “will
be a tableau as nearly as possible like the
painting entitled ‘The Age of Innocence.’”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it over there,” said Mrs. Buffum
to her husband, pointing at the photograph
on the wall, and every one looked that way.
When the curtain was drawn aside, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
was chubby little Hitty Buffum, her hands
clasped upon her breast, a wee bit of a
smile on her parted lips—a very good
counterpart of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s picture.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh my! She looks just like it.
Isn’t she cunnin’?” and similar remarks
greeted the little girl in the first tableau.
She had done her very best for Miss Dayton.
Then the curtain swung across the frame
and Jotham announced, “The next number
will be a song by little Miss Weston.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know as the Weston children
could sing, did you?” queried one neighbor,
but there was no time for an answer,
for little Prue had taken her place on the
improvised platform, and Helen was playing
a little prelude.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston laid her hand upon her husband’s
arm. Would Prue, her little Prue,
get through the song without faltering?
She need not have feared. Out rang the
childish treble in the song which Miss Dayton
had taught her. How fresh and clear
the little voice sounded!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;daisy&nbsp;&nbsp;bloom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;&nbsp;believe&nbsp;&nbsp;’tis&nbsp;&nbsp;true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;play&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;ever&nbsp;&nbsp;eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is&nbsp;&nbsp;early&nbsp;&nbsp;morning&nbsp;&nbsp;dew.<br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;butterfly,—<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just&nbsp;&nbsp;see&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;gauzy&nbsp;&nbsp;wings!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;play&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;bird,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;&nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;sits&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;sings.<br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But&nbsp;&nbsp;always&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;am&nbsp;&nbsp;mama’s&nbsp;&nbsp;girl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;papa’s&nbsp;&nbsp;girlie,&nbsp;&nbsp;too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;next&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;them&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;you.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Putting up her dimpled hands she daintily
kissed her finger tips, made a very cunning
little bow, and tripped back to Miss Dayton,
saying, “Did I do it nice?”
</p>
<p>
“Just splendid, little Prue,” said Jotham.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t have been better,” said old
Mrs. Green.
</p>
<p>
Then Prue crept up on her father’s lap to
see “all the other tabs,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“The ‘Chapeau Blanc,’ which Miss Dayton
says means the White Hat,” announced
Jotham. This time the curtain swept aside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
to disclose Phœbe Small’s little face beneath
a hat with white gauzy ruffles upon the
brim, and a feather held in place by a knot
of blue ribbon. A pearly kerchief about
the shoulders was most becoming to Phœbe,
whose usually expressionless face looked
almost piquant under the saucy white hat
and feather.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t she look like a photograph?”
whispered Mrs. Small, “and a good deal
nicer, if I do say it as shouldn’t,” and Mrs.
Small looked around with a sniff at those
present who possibly thought their daughters
prettier.
</p>
<p>
Now, Phœbe’s principal defects were an
abundance of freckles, and an absence of
character in her small face; but the costume
was becoming, and the freckles not apparent
in the light in which she was posed;
so her heart was delighted with words of
commendation, and she hoped that Jotham
Potts had seen her tableau.
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, Jotham had not seen
her; for, having announced that number,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
he had sat down and waited for Miss Dayton
to appear. The next number on the
programme was his, and now Helen stepped
from behind the curtain to announce it.
</p>
<p>
“We will now listen to a solo by Jotham
Potts.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oo! oo! Does your Jotham sing?”
asked Mrs. Brimblecom of Mrs. Potts.
</p>
<p>
“Why, no; leastways I never heard
him,” said Jotham’s mother, with a twinkle
in her eyes, for did she not know of
Jotham’s evenings spent in practising this
very solo with Miss Dayton’s accompaniment?
</p>
<p>
Randy had said one day to Helen,
“You’d ought to hear Jotham Potts whistle.
He does it just splendid. It sounds just
like the brook rippling.”
</p>
<p>
When Helen made her plans for the entertainment,
she invited him to give a
whistling solo.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’d do anything to ’blige you, Miss
Dayton, but who’d want to hear me whistle?”
said Jotham.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
Then Helen told the boy how many people
gave whistling solos in the city, with a
piano accompaniment, and Jotham consented
to “jest try it” with the piano.
</p>
<p>
After announcing the number, Helen
seated herself, and played a pretty little
prelude, and then Jotham commenced to
whistle a simple piece which Helen played,
called “The Alpine Echo,” in which there
was an imitation of an Alpine horn, followed
by echoing notes an octave higher.
</p>
<p>
Jotham was, indeed, a charming whistler,
and as his courage rose, his notes sounded
true and flutelike, making the song and
echoes, the piano ever aiding him, until
with a final thrill and flourish he finished
his solo, and, blushing and bowing,
retired.
</p>
<p>
The little assembly was much excited
and there were repeated calls for one more
whistling solo, and cries of “fine,” and
“that beats all,” and “whistle just once
more, Jotham.” So Helen resumed her seat
at the piano, and this time Jotham whistled
a medley in which were heard “The Girl I
Left Behind Me,” “Yankee Doodle,” and
“The Star-Spangled Banner.”

<span class='caption'>“There stood Randy as the Demure little Maid”</span>
</div>
<p>
“Hooray for Jotham and Miss Dayton,
I say!” shouted Reuben Jenks, and everybody
cheered.
</p>
<p>
Jotham was very happy over his musical
success, and with a beaming face he
announced, “Our next tableau is a
copy of the large photograph on the right
wall called ‘The Broken Pitcher,’ by
Greuze.”
</p>
<p>
This time the curtain drew aside and
there stood Randy, sweet Randy, as the
demure little maid with the broken pitcher
hanging to her wrist, her beautiful hair
loosely bound, and her large gray eyes looking
out at one for all the world like the
Greuze model.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t she lovely, mother?” said Jotham,
who had stolen out in front of the frame
in order to make sure of seeing this tableau.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I must say, she is,” said Mrs.
Potts. “She’s always a pretty girl, but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
do declare to-night she’s nothin’ short of
handsome.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say,” said Jotham, and even
Randy’s parents were surprised at her
beauty. The tableau was recalled, and
this time Randy blushed most becomingly
because of the encore.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do see my Randy!” called little
Prue, who had been nodding when the
tableau was first shown, and awoke with
a start to see her dear Randy looking out
from the frame.
</p>
<p>
“The next number will be a solo by
Katie Buffum.” Immediately wee Katie
was in position. She was not diffident in
the least, and clasping her chubby hands
she at once piped up with cheery voice:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Once&nbsp;&nbsp;there&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;little&nbsp;&nbsp;mouse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;&nbsp;bigger&nbsp;&nbsp;than&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;fumb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;&nbsp;crept&nbsp;&nbsp;into&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;pocket,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;hunted&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;crumb.<br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I&nbsp;&nbsp;put&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;finger&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;see&nbsp;&nbsp;what&nbsp;&nbsp;there&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;it;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;little&nbsp;&nbsp;mouse&nbsp;&nbsp;was&nbsp;&nbsp;naughty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;bit&nbsp;&nbsp;me&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;minute.”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>
This solo, so cunningly sung by the pudgy
little mite, “brought down the house,” and
little Katie and her family were delighted
with the praise which she received. Still
the little girl stood upon the platform until
the audience began to think that she wished
to sing another verse.
</p>
<p>
“Go on, Katie,” called her brother Jack,
“what yer waiting for?”
</p>
<p>
“I forgot somefin and I dunno what.
Oh, yes, I do. It’s dis,” and, making a
comical little bow, this very conscientious
little soloist left the platform, feeling that
now her performance was complete.
</p>
<p>
Every one laughed and gave Katie more
praise, and she curled up in her mother’s
lap, feeling her wee self to be a very successful
singer.
</p>
<p>
“We will now look at a tableau called
‘Titian’s Daughter,’” announced Jotham.
</p>
<p>
Away flew the curtain and Jemima Babson
stood in the fine pose, copying to perfection
the engraving of that subject.
Jemima was resplendent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh!” ejaculated every one. A glint
of bright light shone in her eyes. She had
liked that picture better than any which
Miss Dayton had shown the girls when they
had called for the first rehearsal, and was
delighted when Helen chose it for her
tableau.
</p>
<p>
Next came her sister Belinda as the
“Magdalene.” Belinda always wore her
yellow hair in braids, but to-night it shone
like rippling gold over her shoulders. With
her blue eyes uplifted, and the shimmering
mass of yellow hair, who could believe that
the “Magdalene” was Belinda Babson, the
girl who climbed every apple tree in her
father’s orchard, and laughed at chance
passers-by from the highest branches.
</p>
<p>
“A solo by Miss Dayton will close the
entertainment.”
</p>
<p>
Helen had sung at church with the
congregation, but until to-night no one,
not even Randy, had heard her sing a
solo.
</p>
<p>
Ah, how sweet and clear sounded her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
voice as, looking across at old Sandy
McLeod, she sang “The Bluebells of Scotland.”
</p>
<p>
The proverbial pin could have been
heard had it been dropped. As the last
notes ceased, old Sandy arose, and, stoutly
thumping on the floor with his cane,
shouted, “Well, noo, that’s bonny, say I,
Sandy McLeod.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” said little Reuben Jenks,
under his breath, for he sat quite near old
Sandy and was a bit afraid of him. The
old Scotchman owned a large farm on the
outskirts of the town and was reported to
have a deal of money, which most people
said he never spent. He lived alone and
was said to be rather crusty.
</p>
<p>
One day, when out for a walk, Helen, in
passing his door, saw old Sandy sitting on
his door-stone, trying to thread a needle.
Helen paused for a moment, saying kindly,
“Please let me thread it for you.”
</p>
<p>
The old man scowled and hesitated, then
surrendered the needle. Helen threaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
it; then, after a few pleasant words, resumed
her walk.
</p>
<p>
The old fellow mumbled something, possibly
thanks, and ever after that morning
pulled off his cap to Helen when he met
her.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gray laughed when Helen said she
intended to invite him to the entertainment,
saying that he would never come.
He came, however, very promptly, and it
was for him she sang the old Scotch ballad.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Helen, “let us all sing,
‘Should Auld Acquaintance be Forgot,’”
and with a will they sang it, old Sandy
joining in the chorus.
</p>
<p>
It was now quite late, but good old Parson
Spooner rose and proposed three cheers
for the young lady who had planned such
a beautiful entertainment. They were
given heartily, and then every one crowded
around Helen to clasp her hand and thank
her again, and of all the merry party no
one was happier than she.
</p>
<p>
Turning to Mrs. Gray, after the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
guest had departed, Helen said, “I have
often helped to entertain, with some success,
but in the city one does not always
feel the thanks so enthusiastically expressed
to be sincere, but who could
doubt the genuineness of the kind words
spoken to-night?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—CALLERS</h2>
<p>
“Randy, wake up!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, oh yes, in a minute,” Randy
answered, drowsily.
</p>
<p>
“No, now, Randy, wake up now! I want
to talk about those tab things what we had
last night,” and two little soft arms wound
their way about sleepy Randy’s neck.
</p>
<p>
Randy rubbed her eyes, laughing as she
said, “Do call them tableaux, Prue, can’t
you remember that? Tableaux, Prue, say
so.”
</p>
<p>
“Tabby-lows!” shouted Prue. “How’s
that?”
</p>
<p>
“Better,” said Randy, still laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Well, whatever you call ’em, yours
was the prettiest, Randy dear, the very
prettiest, and Jotham said so, too, so of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
course it’s true,” said little Prue, who had
been sitting up in bed in order to see her
sister’s face when she repeated the compliment.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Prue,” said Randy, “did he say
that because you asked him?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,” said the child, whose smiling
face now assumed an injured expression.
“He didn’t say it to me ’tall. He
said it to his mother; I heard him, and
she said she thought so, too, I heard her;
she sat just behind us. Now, Randy
Weston, I thought it was real nice to tell
you, and that’s what I waked you up for.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s all very nice,” Randy answered,
“that you liked my picture best; and do
you know, little sister, I would rather have
you pleased than almost any one, next to
father and mother.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” questioned the little girl, in
genuine surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said her sister, “you’re a
little girl who means just what she says.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do mean it, Randy dear; you did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
look just the best of any one, but you’d
ought to seen Jotham,” she continued, “he
meant it, too. He meant it just <em>tremenjous</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Jotham’s kind, too,” said Randy;
then, with a happy little sigh, she turned
a smiling face to little Prue as she said,
“’most every one’s good, I do believe.”
</p>
<p>
“Not near as good as you, Randy,” said
Prue, thoughtfully; but, she added, brightening,
“I mean to be good all day, ’cause
why do you s’pose, Randy? ’Cause I had
such a good time last night.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good reason,” said Randy.
Soon Randy proposed dressing, and at the
breakfast table Prue resumed the conversation
with which she had awakened Randy.
</p>
<p>
All agreed that it had been just a lovely
evening, but the little girl was not quite
satisfied.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, we did have a splendid time,”
said she, “but I want you to say my Randy
was just the best of all.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course, we say so,” said her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
father, laughing; “but who sang a nice
little song?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I ’most forgot, I sang a little tune
and so did Katie Buffum.”
</p>
<p>
“So you did, so you did,” said her father,
“and your mother and I thought you little
girls did your parts well.”
</p>
<p>
“I think they all did wonderful,” said
Mrs. Weston. “I was jest proud of my girls,
and my neighbors’ children, too. I do
declare, I believe Miss Dayton can do anything.
Last evening jest did me good.
Well, this won’t do for me,” she added,
“there’s a sight to do to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll help,” said Randy and Prue together.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’ll have to have you help me,
Randy, if you’re a mind to.”
</p>
<p>
“Me too, me too,” cried Prue.
</p>
<p>
So Randy filled a large pan with hot
water and Prue armed herself with a long
towel, and the two commenced work as if
their lives depended upon it.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston was an energetic woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
and soon her pies were made and baked,
and standing to cool upon the table. The
children had worked bravely all the forenoon,
Randy doing a great deal to be helpful,
and Prue assisting in many small things.
Randy was just thinking that she would
surely scorch if she remained in the hot
kitchen another minute, when such an
interesting thing happened.
</p>
<p>
Up the well-trodden path to the kitchen
door came Mrs. Hodgkins, “the best woman
in town and the newsiest,” as Silas Barnes
had described her.
</p>
<p>
The children were always delighted to
see her coming, as a call from Mrs. Hodgkins
meant numberless scraps of gossip,
and in a small country town where neighbors
are few and far between, anything in
the shape of news is welcome.
</p>
<p>
Laboriously the good woman stepped
from door-stone to threshold, and voluminously
filling the wooden rocker which Mrs.
Weston offered her, she fanned herself with
her handkerchief, ejaculating between gasps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
for breath, “Lor’ me! How hot it is! Ef
I ever get my breath again, I’ll try ter talk
a spell.” But it would have been something
greater than shortness of breath that
could have completely silenced Mrs. Hodgkins.
A few energetic movements of the
palm-leaf fan which Randy offered her, a
few moments of jerky rocking in the old
wooden rocker, and she was ready to begin.
</p>
<p>
“Well there, Mis’ Weston, I b’lieve I can
talk now,” said she. “Joel was goin’ over
to the barn raisin’, an’ I told him I didn’t
care nothin’ ’bout seein’ it; but ef he’d a
mind to drive me as fur as your house, I’d
call in an’ look at yer a spell, ’n’ I can’t
spare the time to talk ’n’ not do somethin’
at the same time,” and she drew from a
capacious bag an old woollen stocking, saying,
“I thought I’d bring my knittin’ along
and p’haps git this stockin’ footed down
while I was talkin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, that’s a woollen stocking,” said
little Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Lor’ yes, child, it’s one of
Joel’s winter stockin’s. I was up attic yesterday huntin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
over my rag bag, ’n’ I came
across a lot of his old winter stockin’s that
I’d ’bout decided to throw away, ’n’ I says
to myself, ‘Sophrony Hodgkins, that’s
downright wasteful,’ ’n’ I’ve just set myself
a task to foot ’em down ’fore winter.”
Her needles clicked furiously, and she knit
around several times before she spoke
again. With her brows contracted she
worked until she felt sure that her knitting
was “straightened out,” then she paused
for a chat.
</p>
<p>
“Did you know,” she commenced, “that
Phœbe Small was a beggin’ an’ a teasin’
her pa to send her to boardin’ school?
Well, she is, ’n’ none of the girls could find
out what put it in her head ter want ter
go ’til Jemima Babson teased it out of
her. Seems at the picnic Miss Dayton, in
some story she was tellin’ the children, let
out that she went away from home ter
school, ’n’ Phœbe got the idee that ter go
away ter school would jest be the makin’
of her. Jemima don’t care what she says,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
an’ she up an’ told Phœbe that it ‘would
take more ’n boardin’ school to make her
as sweet as Miss Dayton,’ all of which was
true, but not ter Phœbe’s likin’.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Is</em> she going to boarding school?”
asked Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Land, no! Her ma told her to wait ’til
she’d learned all there was ter learn at our
deestric’ school ’fore she talked ’bout goin’
anywhere else; and that ’bout finished it.”
</p>
<p>
Here Mrs. Hodgkins, who had said all
this without stopping, paused to take
breath. “I shouldn’t like my girls to be
away at boardin’ school,” said Mrs. Weston,
“and I think Mrs. Small would feel ’bout
as I do.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ there’s Mrs. Buffum,” continued
Mrs. Hodgkins, “with all her children, ’n’
she says they’ve got to be where she can
see ter them, an’ git their larnin’ ter home,
and now I’ll tell yer the joke. It seems
Miss Dayton laughed when she heard about
it, for she wasn’t at boardin’ school at all;
she was at school, and was boardin’ at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
big hotel with her aunt, ’n’ the hotel was
near the school. But there, ye know
Phœbe Small never gits anything more ’n
half right.
</p>
<p>
“But I’ll tell ye somethin’ worth tellin’.
Old Sandy McLeod’s comin’ to meetin’!”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say!” ejaculated Mrs. Weston,
lifting her hands, and letting them fall
upon her lap, thereby showing the surprise
which Mrs. Hodgkins thought this piece of
news deserved.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, it was this way,” continued
the bearer of this pleasant bit of
gossip; “it commenced with Miss Dayton’s
doin’ a few little things fer him. Nobody
b’lieved fer a minute that he’d come to
Mrs. Gray’s, to the entertainment; but Miss
Dayton asked him in her pretty way, and
he hadn’t the heart ter refuse ter come, ’n’
he had such a nice evenin’, and heard her
sing that Scotch song, and all, ’n’ he says
now he’s made a great mistake stayin’ off
by himself so long. An’ he’s been to Parson
Spooner and, ef you’ll believe it, hired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
a whole pew, sayin’ he could well afford to;
en’ he says that as there’s only one in his
family, any one that wants ter can sit in
his pew, any time.
</p>
<p>
“He says he always went ter church,
though he calls it ‘kirk,’ or something like
that, when he was a young man and lived
in Scotland; an’ he says, rain or shine,
we’ll see him in his place every Sunday,
after this. When somebody asked him
what made him think of goin’ ter church
again, he drew that great rough hand of
his across his eyes, and jist said, ‘It’s all
the doin’ of that lass,’ meanin’ Miss Dayton.
And let me tell yer somethin’ queerer
than that! Did ye notice old Nathan
Lawton the other night?
</p>
<p>
“My! how his eyes twinkled when the
children were singin’. Ye know he’s dreadful
fond of children; but ye know, too,
ef ye know anything, that he’s tighter ’n
the bark of a tree. Well, Miss Dayton
heard say what a bad room fer heatin’
that schoolroom was, and how the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
buildin’ was kind er fer off fer most of the
children.
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, after we’d seen all the pictures,
or what yer call ’ems, and she’d sung
her song so sweetly, old Nathan spoke
ter her, an’ thanked her for the pleasant
evenin’, sayin’ he’d do most anythin’ ter
obleege her, in return, as ye might say, fer
his enjoyment; and I had ter laugh softly
ter myself when she put her little white
hand on his arm and said she thought
nothin’ would please her so much as ter
think, when she went home, that the
children here would start ter school in a
comfortable, warm room, ’specially ef it
could be one that was handy for them all;
and she asked him, as one of the see-lect-men,
ter manage it some way.
</p>
<p>
“He just took one look at the smilin’
face lookin’ up at him, and then and there
offered the use of that front room of his’n,
and promised ter keep it roastin’ warm all
winter, from his own woodpile. His house
is just about the handiest ter every one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
any house in town, and I do say that was
a han’some offer.
</p>
<p>
“Any other folks might have asked him
’til they got tired askin’; but he couldn’t
refuse her, ’n’ I don’t wonder. She’s just
done us a world of good this summer, ’n’ in
such an easy, pretty way that we’ve just
enjoyed it.
</p>
<p>
“And now I’ve come ter what fetched
me here ter day. Mrs. Gray said ter me
that Miss Dayton never went to an apple-bee;
and I was thinkin’ she got up that
picnic, and that splendid evenin’ with the
music,”—“and tab things,” said Prue,—“an’
I’ve been thinkin’ it’s ’bout time we
got up somethin’ fer her,” said good Mrs.
Hodgkins, and she beamed upon Mrs. Weston
and Randy as she waited for their
approval.
</p>
<p>
“I think so too,” said Randy and her
mother together; “but do you think that
she would enjoy an apple-bee?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we couldn’t get up anything
fine,” said Mrs. Hodgkins; “but they do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
say that our apple-bees are ’bout the best
that they have anywhere ’round here.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston thought a moment, then
said: “Our house is the biggest in the
neighborhood, an’ Miss Dayton has been
so kind to Randy and Prue that I’ll say
we’ll have the apple-bee here, and I think
we’ll try extry hard to make it a pleasant
one. I’m real glad you thought of it, Mrs.
Hodgkins. I think we’ll all enjoy it, an’ if
Miss Dayton does, that’s all we’ll ask for.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, ef here ain’t Joel,” said Mrs.
Hodgkins, “an’ I’ll have ter be goin’; but
I’ll come over an’ help ye git ready for the
apple-bee, so good-by ’til I see ye again,”
and she hastily took her departure, puffing
down the walk like a small engine, and
clambering into the wagon beside her husband.
“Good-by, I’ll be over ter help ye,”
she cried, looking back; then they jogged
off down the road.
</p>
<p>
Randy and her mother turned from the
doorway and walked back into the kitchen.
“Look at that clock, Randy!” exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
Mrs. Weston; “I guess it’ll be a funny dinner
to-day,” and she commenced to make
hasty preparations for the noon meal.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston laughed good-naturedly when
he heard of the forenoon caller, and in consequence
the “picked-up dinner.” “Lots of
folks haven’t as good a dinner as this,
mother,” said he, “and I must say, I’m
glad she came in ter talk ter ye and so
make ye stop workin’ a spell. Where is
Prue?”
</p>
<p>
Sure enough, the little girl who was
always eager to tell a part of any happening
was, for once, not in evidence. So busy
had Randy and her mother been, preparing
the dinner, that Prue had not been missed.
</p>
<p>
“She went out when Mrs. Hodgkins
went, don’t you remember, mother?” said
Randy. “She ran down the path, waving
her hand and saying good-by when they
drove away.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Randy, run out and find her, and
tell her ter come in ter dinner. Dear me!
I hope she hasn’t got inter some scrape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
She’s been out of sight long enough fer
anything.” Out rushed Randy, calling
loudly, “Prue! Prue! where are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m right here, and I’m very busy,”
came an answering shout from behind the
house.
</p>
<p>
Around the house ran Randy, and such
a funny sight she saw!
</p>
<p>
“Why, Prue Weston, you naughty girl!”
said Randy in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t naughty,” said the child.
</p>
<p>
“You are, too,” responded Randy, “to
plague kitty like that. You just take her
out of that rain-water tub this minute! If
she wasn’t the best old cat in the world, she
would have scratched you well for ducking
her like that.”
</p>
<p>
Prue tried to lift pussy out, and Randy
ran to help her.
</p>
<p>
Poor pussy! If Randy had been a few
minutes later, she must surely have been
drowned, for, just as Randy arrived, Prue
was holding Tabby’s head under water
“to let it soak,” she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
</p>
<p>
“What ever made you do such a thing?”
questioned Randy, when the cat was once
more on dry land; “don’t you know that
in a few minutes more you would have
drowned her?”
</p>
<p>
“Drowned!” said Prue in a horrified
whisper, “drowned, did you say, Randy?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, of course,” said Randy, impatiently;
“don’t you <em>know</em> she’d drown
with her head under water?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Randy, that’s awful!” said Prue.
“I didn’t mean to hurt Tabby. I only
meant to help her. She comed down from
the field what’s been burned over, and she
was all smutty, and I thought I’d give her
a good washing; so I put her in the tub,
but the smut sticked awful, and I thought
I’d soak her and p’rhaps she’d wash easier;
and, Randy, whatever you say, she <em>isn’t</em>
drowned one mite. Just see her washing
herself dry in the sun.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Prue, Prue!” said Randy, “what
shall I do with you? You do the queerest
things! Go tell Tabby you’re sorry this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
minute. If kitty had died, just think how
you’d felt.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, don’t you make me cry, Randy,”
said Prue, “’cause you know I love Tabby,
and I didn’t mean to hurt her.”
</p>
<p>
The cat was an unusually placid animal,
or she never would have permitted a little
girl to do such a thing. Prue had always
used her for a doll, dressing her up in all
sorts of things, and sometimes dragging
her about in a wooden box which she
called a “carriage.” This alleged vehicle
was an old soap box, beautifully
padded with a woollen shawl. It had
neither wheels nor springs, and as little
Prue dragged it along, it thumped over
twigs and stones with the most surprising
jolts. Pussy, however, seemed to have a
species of lethargy, for she slept through
it all; so Prue insisted that she liked the
ride. The family declared the cat to be
absolutely without vim; but that deficiency
in her make-up made her a delightful plaything
for Prue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
After dinner Mrs. Weston talked long
and seriously with her little daughter, telling
her that as pussy was so gentle and
willing to be played with, she ought to be
very kind to her and never do anything
that Tabby would not like.
</p>
<p>
“But I wanted Tabby to be clean in
time for the folks to see her when we
have the apple-bee,” said Prue.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she’ll be clean as clean can be
by that time,” said her mother, smiling.
“She’ll have a whole week to wash in. I
think that when you wish to do something
to kitty different from what you’ve done
before, you’d better come and ask me
first.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” said the little girl, promptly,
and Mrs. Weston knew that pussy was
safe from any new torment, for Prue
always kept her word, and she loved
Tabby dearly.
</p>
<p>
Early in the afternoon, as Mrs. Weston
sat by the window mending, another wagon
stopped at the door; and this time a tall,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
angular woman came up the path with
nervous haste. The door was open, and
without waiting to knock, the caller walked
in and seated herself.
</p>
<p>
“There, I guess you’re s’prised to see
me, Mis’ Weston, but I jest had ter come.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am surprised,” responded Mrs.
Weston; “but I’m just as pleased ter see
ye. Take off yer bunnit.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take it off jest ter show it ter ye,”
said Mrs. Jenks. “I thought I’d had a
change of heart years an’ years ago, but
I guess I’ve jest got it now.”
</p>
<p>
“Do tell! Why, Mrs. Jenks, how ye
talk,” and in blank amazement Mrs.
Weston stopped mending, the stocking,
however, still drawn over her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Well, ye might as well stop mendin’
an’ listen, fer I’ve come ter tell ye quite
a story. It all began with this bunnit.
I stepped over ter Mis’ Gray’s one mornin’
of an arrant, an’ I chanced to say
something about not havin’ a decent bunnit
fer Sunday, an’ I said I had a bunnit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
I’d bought down ter Barnses and quite a
lot of old ribbon that was plenty good
enough to trim it with; but, says I, I’ve
no more idee how to trim it than a cat.
Miss Dayton was just comin’ in the door
with a lot of wild flowers and green stuff,
and she offered, so sweetly, to call over in
the afternoon and jest tack the ribbons
on fer me that, some way, I had ter let her
do it.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she came over and I got out my
ribbon—it was that I had on a blue dress
of mine once—and she sat down to trim
it. It took some time, and to this day I
don’t know how it came about, but the first
thing I knew she was a-makin’ me see how
much better it was to give rather than
receive. Now I’ve been pretty ‘near’ and
savin’, but I never meant ter be mean; but
she led me to talk of the time when Reuben
was little, and ’fore I knew it I was tellin’
that girl how I used to leave my work jist
ter look at him in the old wooden cradle.
I told her what I’d most forgot myself:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
how I could never let him lay there, but
jest had ter take him up and hug him jest
a minute an’ then go on with my work.
I’ve never meant ter be hard with the boy,
but p’r’aps I forgit sometimes that he’s
pretty young still.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Miss Dayton looked up from the
bows she was makin’ pretty, and says
she, ‘Reuben’s a nice little fellow, and I
think, if you were to try it, you’d find he
liked petting still. I’ve talked with him
many times since I’ve been here, and I find
that his one idea seems to be to grow up
as fast as possible so as to be able to help
father and mother.’
</p>
<p>
“I tell ye, Mis’ Weston, I was all took
back to find a sweet young girl who was
’most a stranger to us had learned my
boy’s good traits ’fore I had. Well, when
Reuben came in jist ’fore supper-time with
his jacket with a big tear in it, I was jist
ready ter say somethin’. He took the
jacket off and hung it on my chair ter be
mended; and layin’ his hand on my shoulder, he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
‘I wish I didn’t get my things
tore quite so often, mother, but this time I
couldn’t help it.’
</p>
<p>
“It took lots er resolution, but I jest
kissed him on his forehead, and the s’prised
look on his face made me realize how long
it had been sence I’d kissed him before.
</p>
<p>
“‘Reuben,’ says I, ‘no matter what I
say when I speak hasty, just remember
that yer mother thinks the world of ye!’
</p>
<p>
“‘F you’ll believe me, that boy flew at
me, and puttin’ his arms round my neck he
said, ‘Why, mother, a minute ago I was
awful sorry, and now I’m almost glad I
tore my jacket.’
</p>
<p>
“‘So be I,’ says I, and then we both
laughed, but we were jest as near cryin’,
and I tell you, Mis’ Weston, I ain’t never
goin’ ter have such a distance, so to speak,
between my boy and me as there has been;
I guess we understand each other now.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t know when I’ve heard
any better news,” said Mrs. Weston, taking
off her glasses and slowly wiping them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
“I think pretty well of little Reuben, and
I b’lieve, properly encouraged, he’ll make
a good man.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, it beats all how Miss Dayton
does things,” said Mrs. Jenks. “Some folks
would have blundered about it in a way
that would have made me mad, but to this
day, I do say, I don’t know how she done
it. And look at that bunnit,” continued
enthusiastic Mrs. Jenks, “didn’t she make
them bows pretty? I declare, there ain’t a
prettier bunnit in the meetin’-house than
that.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis pretty,” assented Mrs. Weston;
“just as pretty as it can be.”
</p>
<p>
“So I say,” said Mrs. Jenks, “and now
this mornin’ I met Mis’ Hodgkins and her
husband. ‘They’d just come from here,’
they said, ‘and,’ says Mis’ Hodgkins, ‘we’re
goin’ ter have the first apple-bee ter Mis’
Weston’s and,’ says she, sorter smilin’, ‘I
ain’t sure’s you’ll be very anxious ter help,
but we’re all goin’ ter do our part ter help
make a grand time fer Miss Dayton;’ and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
says I, ‘If it’s fer Miss Dayton, I’ll agree
to contribute anything you like toward the
supper, and I’ll go right over now an’ tell
Mis’ Weston so.’ My, but didn’t she look
at me! I laughed ter myself, an’ I said
right out loud, as I drove off, ‘Matilda
Jenks, this is the last time any one will
have a chance ter call ye stingy.’
</p>
<p>
“I commenced this mornin’ by givin’
Reuben a lot of maple sugar to treat the
boys with, and I tell you Miss Dayton’s
’bout right, it does feel good to give.
We’ve been prospered, and from this time
forth I ain’t goin’ ter be foolish with this
world’s goods; but I <em>vow</em> I won’t be mean;
so I’ve come ter say that if there’s anythin’
I can offer ter help make the bee a success,
jest say the word an’ you shall have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Jenks,” said Mrs. Weston, kindly,
“I always said ye hadn’t but one fault,
and now you’ve overcome that, seems to
me you’re pretty near perfect.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess there’s room fer improvement,”
said Mrs. Jenks, grasping her friend’s extended hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
“but I’ve started in the right
direction. Now, I must be goin’, and remember
I’ll do anything ter help along
that bee.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston promised to remember, and
as rapidly as she came Matilda Jenks
strode down the path and drove away.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later Randy came running
in at the door. “Oh, mother,” said
she, “I ran out to look for Prue again,
while Mrs. Jenks was talking, and, mother,
she’s doing the cunningest thing. She’s
playing read. She’s lying on the grass
back of the house, with the fairy book in
front of her. She’s making b’lieve read
to Tabby. Do come and see her.”
</p>
<p>
Softly they made their way around the
house and, sure enough, there lay Prue,
the wonderful fairy book before her, her
elbows on the book, and her chin in her
hands. Soon they were near enough to
hear what she was reading, and yet not to
be observed.

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>
“Now, Tabby,” she was saying, “you
<em>mustn’t</em> go to sleep when I’m reading to
you. Now you listen: The princess—that’s
Miss Dayton, Tabby—is very beautiful, and
so I know there must be a prince, somewhere,
that she knows; ’cause, Tabby, in
the fairy tales the princesses always has
princes; and, Tabby, I’ll tell you truly,
Miss Dayton is prettier than any picture
in this book. And, Tabby, she loves little
girls and big girls, like my Randy, and she
loves big womens and old womens and old
mens, like Sandy McLeod; and, Tabby, I
b’lieve, I most b’lieve she loves you, and
I’m going to ask her.
</p>
<p>
“She prob’ly does love you; she seems
to love everybody. This isn’t all in the
book, Tabby, but what I tell you that isn’t
in the book is true. I’m most glad the
fairy stories ain’t true; for if things did
happen like what’s in the book, maybe
you’d turn into a frog, and then, Tabby, I
couldn’t hug you.”
</p>
<p>
Here Tabby rubbed her head against
Prue’s little arm. “There,” said the child,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
“you <em>knew</em> what I said, didn’t you?” and
she sprang up, catching Tabby in her arms
to “love her,” as she called it.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, did you hear me reading to my
kitty?” shouted Prue, as she caught sight
of her smiling audience.
</p>
<p>
“We heard ye, and I guess some of it
was full as pretty as what was in the
book,” said Mrs. Weston, and together the
three wended their way back to the house,
followed by Tabby.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE APPLE-BEE</h2>
<p>
The apple-bee was to occur on Thursday
evening, and Mrs. Weston and Randy, with
little Prue for “errand boy,” had been
busily employed in preparation for the
delightful event. Prue made a fine little
page, so delighted was she to be useful.
</p>
<p>
“Bring me the yellow mixin’ bowl, Prue,”
called Mrs. Weston. Into the closet darted
Prue, and over to the table with the big
bowl she hastened. “Now what shall I do
to help the apple-bee?” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps the apple-bee would like to
have you pull all the stems off these
raisins,” said her mother, laughing. So
Prue sat down upon the large braided rug
near the door and began to stem the raisins
with all her might. Soon Mrs. Hodgkins
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
arrived and imperiously ordered her husband
to “lug in that crock from the wagon.”
</p>
<p>
“For mercy’s sake!” ejaculated Mrs.
Weston, “whatever have you got there?”
as, puffing and blowing, Joel Hodgkins
landed an immense stone crock upon the
kitchen table.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll tell ye,” said Mrs. Hodgkins;
“I know this is no donation party, but I
had this big crock er doughnuts, and I says,
says I, ‘Somebody will eat ’em ef I take ’em
over,’ so here they be.”
</p>
<p>
“Sophrony wouldn’t think she was takin’
part in the bee if some of her prize doughnuts
wasn’t in the treat.”
</p>
<p>
Every one laughed at Joel Hodgkins’s
speech, and the doughnuts were very kindly
received.
</p>
<p>
“We all know that your doughnuts are
the best in town,” said Mrs. Weston, “and
I guess everybody’ll be glad to have one,
I’m sure—” but the remark was left
incomplete as she hastened to the door to
admit Mrs. Jenks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“How are ye, Mrs. Weston? I had Reuben
drive me over, and I’ve brought a lot
of those big red apples, ef ye don’t mind
havin’ ’em. Reuben an’ I have rubbed
and polished ’em ’til they shine like everything.
I thought maybe they’d make the
table look pretty,” and she flushed as she
offered this first contribution of her life.
</p>
<p>
“They will look handsome,” said Mrs.
Weston. “I declare it was real thoughtful
in you to bring them. Why, for goodness’
sake! How many did ye bring?” as Reuben
arrived with basket after basket, which
he placed in a row upon the table, and
then commenced to make another row upon
the swing table on the opposite side of the
room.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve no idee how many there is,” said
Mrs. Jenks. “Reuben an’ I commenced
rubbin’ and polishin’ ’em right after breakfast,
and we never stopped rubbin’ ’til we
was ready to start. Then we packed in the
baskets, and here we be.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the neighbors had removed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
bonnets and shawls, and three energetic
housekeepers, with the help of Randy and
little Prue, succeeded in “keeping things
moving,” as Mrs. Jenks had expressed it.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, Jotham Potts’s dark face
peeped in at the door, with, “Say, Mrs.
Weston, I’m a master hand at chopping, so
any time I can help, just give me a chopping
knife and tray, and I’ll work like a
major.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bear ye in mind, and call ye when
I want ye,” answered Mrs. Weston, and
Prue rushed to the door to offer him a
handful of raisins, saying, “I give them to
you, Jotham, ’cause you’re the biggest and
the nicest boy I know.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, pussy. Hey! where are
you now?” and he swung the child lightly
up on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“May I go with Jotham ’stead of picking
any more raisins?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, run along,” said her mother, glad
to have her in the care of some one whom
she could trust to keep her out of mischief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
So busily did every one work that by
Wednesday night the cooking for the spread
was completed. Old and young had helped
with a will to make the evening a success,
and at last Thursday arrived, although
Prue confided to Randy that she “b’lieved
it never would.”
</p>
<p>
When the final decorations for the apple-bee
were in place, everything needed for
the sumptuous spread ready, there was
absolutely nothing to do but wait patiently
for the evening to come.
</p>
<p>
The apples were to be cut, cored, and
strung in the kitchen, the spread was to be
in the “settin’ room,” and all the rooms
were decorated so gayly that they appeared
festive indeed. Randy had decorated the
“best room,” making it gay with branches
of autumn leaves, in gorgeous colors, and
sprays of scarlet privet berries.
</p>
<p>
The Babson girls had had a bright idea in
regard to trimming the “settin’ room.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the reason we can’t tie the corn
husks together at the tip ends, and keep on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
tying ’til we get enough to go around the
room, and then hang up the long string of
ears and husks just above the pictures?”
queried Belinda Babson.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Belinda!” screamed Randy, “that’s
such a bright idea, what ever made you
think of it?”
</p>
<p>
“I just did think of it, that’s all,” said
Belinda, much pleased that her design for
decoration met with approval. So the
girls rushed out to the barn to find Mr.
Weston and ask permission to use the corn.
</p>
<p>
“Land, yes,” he said when approached,
“use anything within reach, I say, so long
as it helps to make the house look pooty;”
so, laughing gayly, the girls filled their
aprons with corn, and running to the
house commenced, in furious haste, to tie
the husks together.
</p>
<p>
All the young friends had called that
morning in a body to offer their help to
Randy, and she had most gladly accepted
it.
</p>
<p>
While the girls were tying the corn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
husks, Jotham Potts and Reuben Jenks
were making themselves very useful, for
by this time the girls had discovered that
it required a great many ears of corn with
which to garland or festoon the room. The
boys brought the corn in wheelbarrow loads
and then offered to help do the tying.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, boys couldn’t do this,” said Phœbe
Small, who was much piqued to see that
whenever Jotham sat down to rest, he sat
near Randy.
</p>
<p>
“That’s one of your pleasant speeches,
Phœbe,” said Reuben Jenks, before his
friend Jotham could reply; whereat
Phœbe tied a hard knot in a corn husk
with such unnecessary vim that it broke.
</p>
<p>
Reuben laughed slyly; and Randy with
her usual kindness, appearing not to notice
the tilt, praised Phœbe’s pretty arrangement
of red and yellow ears, and thus
smoothed “ruffled feathers.”
</p>
<p>
Jotham looked at Randy with real admiration.
“I b’lieve she always does the right
thing,” thought the boy; so Phœbe’s spite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
only strengthened the admiration of Randy’s
young cavalier.
</p>
<p>
“I think I’ve got a first-rate notion for
decorating,” said Jotham, “and if you’ll
let me and Reuben do it I tell you we can
make that front walk as light as day, and
as handsome as a picture for to-night,
Randy,” and Jotham looked at the girl
with eyes that sparkled with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“Of course I’ll let you do it, if it’s
fine,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Now you needn’t ask questions, for
it’s a secret; and Reuben an’ me’ll do it,
without telling anybody but your pa,”
said Jotham, and out rushed the boys to
hold a whispered conclave on the back
stairs.
</p>
<p>
“My, won’t that be prime!” ejaculated
Reuben, amazed at the brilliancy of Jotham’s
plan, and proud to be taken into
a secret by a boy three years older than
himself.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston laughed long and loudly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
when the boys unfolded their plan, and
declared that he’d do his part of it now.
Accordingly, he soon appeared in the path
which led from the road to the door, and
began to drive long stakes into the ground
on either side of the walk.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing, father?” called
Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Drivin’ stakes, ain’t I?” he responded,
and with that she was obliged to be contented.
The boys were out of sight, and the girls
wondered what they were doing; but when
at night a line of brilliant lights glowed on
each side of the walk, they willingly declared
the decoration a success.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston had driven the stakes quite
near together and every one was capped
with a jack-o’-lantern made from a great
golden pumpkin, so that, from road to doorway,
a line of grinning goblins served to give
a flaming welcome.
</p>
<p>
At last everything was in readiness and
the guests began to arrive. Reuben’s
mother had listened with much interest to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
the boy’s scheme, and had insisted on
donating all the pumpkins required.
</p>
<p>
And now the wagons began to arrive, and
great praise was bestowed upon the boys
for their novel lighting of the walk.
The pumpkins made very fine lamps, and
one giant of its kind, fastened high above
the door, smiled broadly upon each new
arrival.
</p>
<p>
Team after team drove up to the door,
and shouts and laughter rang out on the
crisp evening air as the guests first saw the
gleaming lantern rows.
</p>
<p>
At last nearly every one had arrived, and
the rooms were bright with happy faces.
In one corner a group of old ladies were
chatting about the bees and huskings which
they had enjoyed in their youth.
</p>
<p>
The farmers and their wives were buzzing
away over the latest bit of village gossip,
the women telling it as they “b’lieved it
was,” and the men using convincing arguments
to show that they had heard it
“straight” at the store at the four corners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
Girls and boys tried to out-talk each
other, and everywhere the children ran in
and out, playing “hide-and-seek” behind
the sturdy forms of their elders.
</p>
<p>
Helen had coaxed Randy to refrain from
brushing back every curling lock, telling
her that her hair was made to curl; and
thus convinced, Randy appeared at the bee
with a soft fluff of her light brown hair
making a halo about her face.
</p>
<p>
“I must say Miss Dayton’s right; I like
the looks of it,” said Mrs. Weston, when
Randy appeared before her with her hair
dressed in the manner which Miss Dayton
had suggested; so with much impatience
Randy waited to see the look of approval on
Helen’s face when she should arrive. And
others were looking for Helen in whose
honor this festival was planned.
</p>
<p>
At last a resounding “Whoa! Be still,
can’t ye?” announced the arrival of old
Sandy McLeod, and great was the surprise
when, as Randy opened the door, Helen—smiling,
radiant Helen—came in, saying,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
“Good evening, friends,” and followed by
her ancient cavalier, old Sandy.
</p>
<p>
“The lass is late because too many lads
wanted to bring her,” said Sandy, his old
eyes twinkling.
</p>
<p>
“That is true,” said Helen, laughing, “too
many lads, so I gave my choice to the
eldest. Now for my bundle,” and stepping
out into the centre of the room Sandy
showed, for the first time, that he held a
large parcel.
</p>
<p>
“I have a little surprise for you, dear
friends,” said Helen; “I wished to offer my
mite toward the evening’s pleasure, so I will
ask Mrs. Weston to allow Mr. McLeod—”
</p>
<p>
“Call me Sandy, lass,” said the old man,
gently.
</p>
<p>
“To allow Sandy,” corrected the girl, “to
place this box on the centre of the supper
table, to be opened when we are all seated
around the spread.”
</p>
<p>
So the big box held its place of honor,
and great was the curiosity concerning it.
</p>
<p>
The children now commenced to play
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
“the needle’s eye,” an old game popular
among the country children, which is very
similar to “London Bridge.”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The&nbsp;&nbsp;needle’s&nbsp;&nbsp;eye&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;doth&nbsp;&nbsp;comply<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;thread&nbsp;&nbsp;which&nbsp;&nbsp;runs&nbsp;&nbsp;so&nbsp;&nbsp;true.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;caught&nbsp;&nbsp;many&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;very&nbsp;&nbsp;fine&nbsp;&nbsp;lass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;now&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;&nbsp;caught&nbsp;&nbsp;you.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Little Hitty Buffum found herself a prisoner.
However, she was soon kissed and
released, and through the arch formed by
clasped hands and uplifted arms trooped
the children, keeping time to the sing-song
chant of the queer verse. They saw nothing
funny in the verse, however, and played
the game with great enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the apples were being pared
by industrious hands and soon the “stringing”
began. Merrily the work went on
with jokes and lively chatter, and before
it seemed possible the task was completed.
</p>
<p>
The boys now gathered up the parings,
carried them away, and once more the room
was in order.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, friends,” said Randy’s father,
“let’s all have supper.” No one waited
for a second invitation, and a cheery, happy
party made a complete circle around the
long table. What a spread that was! Hot
baked beans and brown bread, mince pies,
pumpkin pies, gingerbread and doughnuts,
nuts and apples, made a “treat for a king,”
said old Sandy McLeod.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mr. Weston,” said Helen, “please
open my box;” and when the cover was
removed a chorus of “Ohs” and “Ahs”
greeted the sight disclosed. Helen had
sent to Boston for an immense box of
bonbons, and to those simple country people,
who knew naught but home-made confections,
the rose and violet tinted dainties
looked like a fairy gift. But if they were
unacquainted with such candies, it took a
fabulously short time to learn to like them,
and soon the bottom of the box appeared.
</p>
<p>
Happy Helen, to have given so much
pleasure! And now the table which had
been so bountifully spread was beginning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
to look bare, for everybody had had a most
excellent appetite, and had done full justice
to the meal. The chairs were pushed back
and old Sandy asked to have a bit of music.
“The little lassies who sang the other night,
canna they sing?” said he, looking kindly
at Prue and Katie, who were playing “bean
porridge hot” together.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t any pi-ano here,” said Katie.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind that,” said Helen; “I think
if you and Prue sing the little songs which
you sang the other evening so sweetly, Sandy
will, in return, make some music for you.”
</p>
<p>
“That I will,” responded the old man,
heartily; “but there’s naught so blithe as
the sound of a bairnie’s voice.”
</p>
<p>
So wee Katie was mounted upon a chair,
in lieu of a platform, and she sang the little
solo, “Once there was a little mouse,” giving
all the verses, and even remembering
to make a little bow as Helen had taught
her. Indeed, she bowed so vigorously
that she barely escaped losing her balance.
Then she hopped down, and little Prue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
sprang up in her place, singing, “Sometimes
I am a daisy bloom,” just as she
had sung it at Mrs. Gray’s on the evening
of the tableaux. When she had finished
the last lines,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And&nbsp;&nbsp;next&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;those&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;love&nbsp;&nbsp;each&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;you,”<br />
</p>
<p>
she kissed her little finger tips to her
admiring audience, as Helen had taught
her to do.
</p>
<p>
Every one applauded, and old Sandy
called the children to him, saying, “I’ll
make the music for ye now, I wad na hae
the heart to refuse,” and rising hastily he
left the room. Every one was surprised at
this abrupt movement and wondered if the
childish voice had moved him too deeply,
awakening the memories of his Scottish
home and friends.
</p>
<p>
Silent he had ever been in regard to
home and kindred, answering questions in
a manner which invited no further queries;
but since Helen’s stay in the village he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
warmed wonderfully toward his neighbors,
and seemed quite unlike the silent old man
whom they had known.
</p>
<p>
But while they were wondering about
his absence, Sandy reappeared. What a
change! Arrayed in all the bravery of a
Scottish chieftain, old Sandy stood before
them, a picture indeed.
</p>
<p>
Over a kilt of tartan he wore the red
coat and plaid, and on his head, crowning
his white locks, sat a genuine Scotch “bonnet,”
with an eagle feather black as night.
In his hands he carried the bagpipes, and
while the children stared, open-mouthed,
Sandy commenced to play. “Scots Wha
Hae” rang out with a wonderful skirl, followed
by “Bonnie Prince Charlie,” “Jock
o’ Hazeldean,” and a half dozen more, until
old Nathan Lawton declared that there was
no keeping still with such music, and when
at his request the pipes commenced to play
a rollicking reel, old Nathan remarked that
he used to cut “pigeon wings” and he
guessed he could now, took his position in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
the centre of the floor, and proceeded to
cut them in a wonderful manner.
</p>
<p>
If the children were delighted, so were
their elders, for was this not a treat of
which they had not dreamed? and, best of
all, two old people who had been so cold
and forbidding now were warmed and
charmed into a friendly feeling with all
their neighbors.
</p>
<p>
When Sandy and Nathan Lawton stopped
to rest and regain their breath, the young
people crowded around them to thank them
and to examine the fine Scotch costume
which Sandy wore.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a pretty dress and jacket,” said
little Prue, admiringly, “and you’ve got
such a long sash, too.”
</p>
<p>
The child’s admiration for his costume
pleased the old man, and it was of small
consequence to him that she called his kilt
a dress. Lifting Prue upon his knee, he
stroked her short fair curls, telling her
how like the little lass she was who used
to be his playmate in bonnie Scotland.
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span></div>

<img src="images/illus-191.jpg" alt="“‘Why don’t you send the Little Girl a Letter?’”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“‘Why don’t you send the Little Girl a Letter?’”</span>
</div>
<p>
“Is she big as me?” asked the little
girl, all unmindful that Sandy’s child mate
had had many years in which to grow.
</p>
<p>
A moment the old man hesitated, then,
very gently, he told the child upon his knee
of that other child away in bonnie Scotland;
told her that when his little mate
was a child, he had been a child too; that
he had known her all his young life; that
she had grown old as he had, and now—but
here he paused, and practical little
Prue, looking up at him, asked, “Is it far
to Scotland?” Sandy told her that it was
very far indeed.
</p>
<p>
“Too far to send letters?” was the next
question.
</p>
<p>
“No,” he assured her; “it was not as far
as that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why don’t you send the little girl
a letter?” questioned Prue.
</p>
<p>
Those who had heard the question were
fearful that the old Scotchman would be
displeased.
</p>
<p>
For a moment a look of amazement rested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
on Sandy’s face as he stared at the innocent
questioner; then, as with an effort, he said,
“I will, little lass, I will.”
</p>
<p>
“I would,” said little Prue, “and tell
her there’s another little girl, what you
know, sends her love to her, will you,
Sandy?”
</p>
<p>
“Bless the bairn! Ye hae mair wisdom
than ye ken;” adding under his breath,
“a deal mair wisdom than Sandy McLeod.”
</p>
<p>
It was Helen, who, while walking by his
house, had heard Sandy playing the pipes
ever so softly, and looking in, had seen
him playing, and, at the same time, looking
lovingly at the old Scotch costume as
it lay spread out upon the wooden chest in
which it was usually kept. She had coaxed
a part of his story from him that day, and
he had declared he felt better for the telling.
</p>
<p>
The costume was one which his father
had worn as chief of his clan when Sandy
was a young man. There had been a dispute
in which he and his father had been
equally obstinate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
When the old man died, Sandy had left
Scotland, taking with him the suit of tartan,
the bagpipes, and, dearer than all, a
letter in which his father forgave him for
his part in the dispute. Further than this
he refused to talk, saying nothing whatever
as to living kinsmen or friends.
</p>
<p>
Having told a part of his story to Helen,
to which she listened with ready interest
and sympathy, it needed but a hit of judicious
coaxing to get him to promise to play
at the apple-bee.
</p>
<p>
And now the gayety, which had lulled
while every one had listened to the music,
revived, and each one present seemed to
be trying his best to out-talk his neighbor.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t Miss Dayton’s blue dress the very
handsomest dress you ever saw?” said
Jemima Babson.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and isn’t she the handsomest person
you ever saw in <em>any</em> dress?” said
Phœbe Small, looking sharply at Randy,
who was looking unusually pretty with her
hair dressed to show its curls and ripples.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Miss Dayton’s splendid, we all know
that,” said Jotham, blushing furiously; “but
it don’t make it out that Randy Weston
isn’t amazing pretty.”
</p>
<p>
And here another voice chimed in, “Did
yer ever taste anything like that candy in
yer life?”
</p>
<p>
“It was just splendid, and I do b’lieve—”
</p>
<p>
“Have ye noticed Mrs. Jenks? I do
declare, she’s as much different from what
she used ter be as possible. Why, she sent
them fine apples, and gave the hull of them
pumpkins, and—”
</p>
<p>
Just at this point Mrs. Buffum ejaculated,
“Well, as I live! ef it ain’t half-past ten
o’clock,” and she commenced at once to
collect her brood. All were loath to leave
the joyous scene, but the lateness of the
hour made it imperative. Some one proposed
a song before saying good night, and
soon old and young voices chimed sweetly
together as they sang:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“All&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;year&nbsp;&nbsp;round,&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;year&nbsp;&nbsp;round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;seasons&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;you&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;me?<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;go,&nbsp;&nbsp;bleak&nbsp;&nbsp;winds&nbsp;&nbsp;may&nbsp;&nbsp;blow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roses&nbsp;&nbsp;crown&nbsp;&nbsp;winter&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;&nbsp;cheery&nbsp;&nbsp;we&nbsp;&nbsp;be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;glad&nbsp;&nbsp;spring,&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;birds&nbsp;&nbsp;bring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These&nbsp;&nbsp;live&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;&nbsp;loving&nbsp;&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;&nbsp;where’er&nbsp;&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;found;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;May&nbsp;&nbsp;time,&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;hay&nbsp;&nbsp;time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;loving&nbsp;&nbsp;lips,&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;year&nbsp;&nbsp;round.”<br />
</p>
<p>
“Hooray for the apple-bee! Hooray for
Miss Dayton!” shouted Reuben Jenks,
“Hooray for the bagpipes and the dance!”
Every one cheered, and Jotham, laughing
at his friend’s enthusiasm, shouted, “Hooray
for every one and everything!” and
they even cheered that; so, laughing and
cheering, with lively chatter and snatches
of song, wraps were donned and good nights
said.
</p>
<p>
After the last guest had departed, Randy
turned from the doorway, and going back
into the house she sat down opposite her
father, a happy smile upon her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Randy,” said her father, kindly,
as he saw she had something to say.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father,” she said, “doesn’t it make
you happy to see every one having a good
time?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed, it does,” said father and
mother together.
</p>
<p>
“I mean to try always to make people
happy,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” said little Prue; “but now
let’s go to bed.”
</p>
<p>
Randy laughed, and saying, “You’ve
done bravely, Prue, to keep your eyes open
to-night,” led her little sister up the stairs
to their tiny chamber, where soon they were
fast asleep.
</p>
<p>
The Babson girls talked until after midnight
over the evening’s entertainment,
declaring it to be the “very greatest bee
they ever went to.”
</p>
<p>
Phœbe Small, having no sister to talk it
over with, kept the candle burning until
late that night, while she wrote in her diary
a lengthy description of the event. Phœbe
had heard her mother tell of keeping a diary
when she was young, so, of course, Phœbe,
who ardently admired her mother, immediately
commenced to keep one.
</p>
<p>
Old Sandy McLeod, as he gallantly helped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
Helen Dayton to alight at Mrs. Gray’s door,
thanked her over and over again for the
pleasure she had given him in allowing him
to be her escort, telling her that he was
glad enough that she had urged him to play
the pipes, since the music had given such
pleasure; adding, “Old Nathan and old
Sandy hae’ na been the best of friends and
neighbors, but to-night we hae shaken hands
an’ we’re to be friends forever.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’m so glad,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“And ane thing mair, lass,” he interrupted,
“about that letter the little lass
was talking of, I’ll write it to-night!”
</p>
<p>
“It is late, now,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“None too late to write. I’ll do it to-night
and sen’ it to-morrow, as sure as I’m
Sandy McLeod.”
</p>
<p>
True to his word, Sandy sat at his table
until late into the night, writing a long,
long letter. The candle flickered as his
hand moved back and forth across the pages.
</p>
<p>
Many times he paused while writing, and
with his head resting upon his hand, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
seemed to be thinking how best to express
himself, so that his message might find
favor with his old friend and playmate.
</p>
<p>
At last, apparently, the letter was completed
satisfactorily; for as the old man
arose from the table, a faint smile flitted
across his face.
</p>
<p>
Crossing the room to the old chest by the
window, he fumbled about until he brought
from its depths a little package; then,
walking to the table, he placed the tiny
parcel between the folded pages of the letter,
put the letter into its envelope, and with
utmost care addressed it, reading the address
over three times to make sure that it was
correct. Under his pillow he placed the
letter, saying, “With the light o’ day I’ll
start ye on the journey.” And of all the
merry party who laughed and sang away
the hours at the apple-bee, not one possessed
a happier heart than Sandy.
</p>
<p>
And Helen murmured, softly, as she lay
half awake and half asleep, “Every one
was happy to-night.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</h2>
<p>
The sun rose in golden splendor one
morning to find that a curtain of purple
haze prevented his sunship from showing
all his dazzling glory.
</p>
<p>
It was indeed a typical October morning
in New England. For a time the haze prevailed,
holding her own bravely against the
sun, who struggled for supremacy; but at
last he rose triumphant, the mist softly
melting away beneath his warm rays.
</p>
<p>
How fair and tall the slender birches
looked as the bright rays gilded their
white trunks! How cool and deep the
little pool which reflected the birches and
brakes which overhung its edge; and far
away across the field a great black crow
flew, cawing as he winged his way, then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
perched upon a slender twig which swayed
beneath his weight. Tiny sparrows twittered
and chirped as they hopped
about among the dried weeds, searching
among the seed vessels for a possible breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Truly, all things were beautiful that
morning; and Randy, from her chamber
window, looked out upon the lovely scene,
and on her face a smile and tear appeared,—a
smile on the sweet lips in memory of the
summer’s pleasure; a tear at the thought
of Helen’s departure.
</p>
<p>
“It has been the nicest summer I have ever
known,” mused Randy, softly. “Everything
has looked prettier since she taught me how
to look at things. How sweetly she thanked
me for the rose I cut for her without spilling
one of the dewdrops. ’Twas only a
little thing, yet she thanked me as if the
dewdrops were diamonds. Why, she just
made me wild to find something to give to
every one, if giving made such pleasure. I
remember that I said I often wished I had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
more to give, and she showed me, oh, so
plainly, that a smile or a pleasant word
was worth the giving that I felt at once
as if I were rich; for any one can say a
pleasant word and all of us can smile.
Oh, she’s done us ‘a world of good,’ as the
parson’s wife said.”
</p>
<p>
While Randy dreamed at her window,
Helen stood in the doorway at Mrs. Gray’s,
and she, too, was thinking of the summer
so happily spent.
</p>
<p>
Soon she would be at home, and in a few
months the winter season would bring a
round of social engagements.
</p>
<p>
Why had the days so quietly spent
seemed so charming? What was the
secret of their charm? Happy she had
been,—very, very happy,—and so swiftly
had the weeks sped that it seemed impossible
that October had arrived. She had chosen
to spend the summer, contrary to her usual
custom, in a little country village, with no
other thought than that in such a place she
could be sure of rest and quiet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
She was a girl of generous impulses, and
after becoming acquainted with the people
of the neighborhood of the Gray homestead,
many an opportunity for a gracious word
or a generous action presented itself. How
gently and with what ready tact she had
made herself a friend to young and old,
was proven by the genuine regret manifested
whenever her departure was mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Helen had a host of friends of whom to
take leave, and all were charmed and
gladdened to hear that they would see
her sweet face again sometime during the
winter. She had called to see old Sandy
once more before her departure, and he
had had a wonderful bit of news to tell.
</p>
<p>
The letter which he had written after his
return from the apple-bee he had posted
early on the following morning. It was
addressed to Miss Margaret McLean, and
Sandy explained that, as her father had
been a prominent manufacturer in the little
Scottish town in which they had lived for
years, holding large business interests and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
owning a number of mills which bore his
name, the daughter, his only child, must be
well known there; so he had trusted that
the letter, written after so many years’ delay,
might be promptly delivered.
</p>
<p>
Strangely enough, it had never occurred to
Sandy to wonder if his old playmate were
still living. To his great joy, an answer
to the letter came sooner than he had
expected. She was still waiting for him,
she said, as she had ever waited, hoping
that the time would come when he would
forgive her for teasing him,—it had been
but a girlish freak,—and tell her that he
loved her as of old.
</p>
<p>
Her father had lost much of his money
before he died, but she had a “bit of property,”
she said, and she had sold her little
cottage and would leave on the next steamer
for America. She would bring with her a
little Scotch lass, an orphan whom she had
befriended and trained to be a little maid-servant;
and, insisting that Sandy should
meet her and go at once to some kirk to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
married, she closed her letter with love
to Sandy and a blessing for Helen and the
wee lass, Prue. To Helen’s congratulations
he would only say, “It’s your doing, lass,
yours and the bairnie’s.”
</p>
<p>
Sandy confided to Helen that he had
been afraid that Margaret might doubt that
he and the Sandy McLeod of her youth
were one and the same; but, he added: “I
had a proof, I had a proof, lass! I had
a lock o’ her bonnie hair tied wi’ a knot
o’ blue ribbon. I knew she’d na forget
gi’en’ it to me, and I put it in the
letter.”
</p>
<p>
“That was clever,” said Helen.
</p>
<p>
“An’ she said she’d bring it back wi’ her
when she sailed for America,” added the
old Scotchman, joyously; and Helen left
him happy in the thought that although
her farewell saddened him, there soon
would be a dearer friend to greet him.
</p>
<p>
Farmer Gray had driven to the village
early that morning, and when he returned
he greeted Helen cheerily, at the same time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
handing her a letter, saying, “I hope it is
full of good news, Miss Dayton.”
</p>
<p>
It proved to be a letter from her aunt,
urging Helen to start at once for home, as
an uncle who had not seen her since she
was a very little girl was making a short
stay in Boston, and wished very much to
see his niece before he returned to his home
in a western city.
</p>
<p>
“I am proud of you, Helen, as you know,”
wrote the dear old lady, “and I so earnestly
wish Robert to see you that I wish you
would start as soon as you receive this
letter.”
</p>
<p>
Helen left for Boston early that morning,
asking Mrs. Gray to tell Randy that she
would write to her as soon as she reached
home. Helen’s departure was only a day
earlier than she had intended, yet she
regretted to leave in such haste. She had
wished to bid Randy and dear little Prue
an affectionate good-by and reiterate her
promise of a flying visit sometime during
the winter months.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
As she sat looking out of the car window
and watched the little town receding, she
thought of Randy’s sweet face, and like a
vision it appeared before her with grieved
eyes and quivering lips, just as she knew
the girl would look when Mrs. Gray told
her of her friend’s departure. Then a bright
thought occurred to her, and a happy smile
played about her lips.
</p>
<p>
Opening her little bag she took from it a
block of paper, such as she had used for
memoranda, and with a pencil she commenced
a note to Randy. She would obtain
an envelope and stamp as soon as she reached
Boston. Helen possessed a merry wit, and
leaf after leaf of the little block she filled
with a breezy account of her journey. She
described at length the man with three immense
leather bags, who tried in vain to
walk down the aisle with all that baggage,
and was at last compelled to make three
separate trips; the old lady with a box containing
a cat which mewed dismally all the
way; the woman with four children, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
seemed to have an endless supply of lunches,
yet cried for more; the boy peddling prize
candy, and any number of small happenings.
</p>
<p>
The writing served to make the long ride
less tedious, and she knew that the letter
would make Randy smile through her tears.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
When Randy and Prue appeared at breakfast
time they were amazed to find Aunt
Prudence at the table.
</p>
<p>
“Why, when did you come?” questioned
Prue, abruptly, staring at her aunt as if that
lady had been an apparition instead of a
very tangible reality.
</p>
<p>
“I came last night, after you children was
in bed,” said Aunt Prudence, “and I guess
your father was ’bout as s’prised as you be.”
</p>
<p>
“Wal’, I guess I was,” said Mr. Weston.
“Ye was the last person I expected to see
when I stopped near the depot to talk with
neighbor Gray, but I was jest as glad to see
ye as ef ye’d sent word ye was comin’.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston also hastened to assure her
that her unexpected arrival was a pleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
surprise, but the children could not say a
word. Prue was filled with a dread of
Aunt Prudence’s sharp eyes, which would
be sure to detect any sign of plotted mischief;
and Randy, knowing Prue’s intense
dislike of supervision, realized that careful
watching, amounting almost to strategy,
would be necessary to keep the little girl
from vexing Aunt Prudence, thereby actually
showing her how intensely she disliked her.
</p>
<p>
Although the morning hours were fully
occupied, Randy was aware of a subtle
sense of change in Aunt Prudence. She
looked as angular and austere as before,
but her voice seemed less shrill, and her
sharp eyes behind her glasses looked out
with a softened light.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we didn’t really know her
before,” said Randy to Prue.
</p>
<p>
“P’r’aps maybe we didn’t,” answered
Prue. “She calls me Prudence same’s
she did before, but she says it diffe’nt.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it,” said Randy, “her voice is
pleasanter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“And her eyes isn’t always looking at
me, so I don’t darest to move,” said
Prue.
</p>
<p>
Randy turned away quickly, that Prue
need not see her laughing. The idea
that any one could prevent her little sister
from indulging in almost perpetual motion,
seemed utterly funny to her.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later Randy chanced to
hear Prue talking to Tabby, just under
the kitchen window.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Tabby,” she was saying, “if you
lie real still while I drag you ’round, you’ll
get a lovely ride and nobody’ll ever know
it; but if you squirm and act naughty, I’ll
put the basket right back in Aunt Prudence’s
room, and I won’t give you any
ride at all.”
</p>
<p>
Randy waited to hear no more, for upon
looking out over the wide window-sill she
espied naughty little Prue dragging Miss
Prudence’s best cap basket around the
dooryard. She had made Tabby lie in the
basket, then pressing down the cover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
she had fastened the little straw loop and
thus locked Tabby into a very close carriage.
Out rushed Randy, to rescue
Tabby and the pretty basket at the same
time.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you think to do such
naughty things, Prue Weston?” said indignant
Randy; “don’t you know you’re
plaguing Tabby and Aunt Prudence at the
same time?”
</p>
<p>
“Tabby likes to ride,” asserted Prue,
“and I don’t care if I do plague—” but
the mischievous little elf did not finish the
sentence, for on looking up, there stood
Aunt Prudence in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
Randy’s face was suffused with hot
blushes, and Prue, naughty little Prue,
looked completely abashed.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Prudence was the first to speak.
“Bring my basket to me,” said she,
abruptly, but not unkindly.
</p>
<p>
Slowly Prue unfastened the cover of the
pretty, round cap basket, and with even
more moderation Tabby stepped out, stopping to yawn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
and stretch while her hind
legs were still in the basket.
</p>
<p>
Prue stooped and energetically lifted her
out upon the ground. Randy watched
Aunt Prudence while Prue walked very
slowly toward her, the forefinger of her
left hand in her mouth, while with the
right hand she reluctantly handed the
basket to its owner.
</p>
<p>
Did Aunt Prudence smile? Randy
thought she espied a twinkle in the
sharp eyes behind the glasses.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Aunt Prudence, “s’pose you
come into my room while I show you something
worth looking at.”
</p>
<p>
Into the house, slowly following Aunt
Prudence, went Prue and Randy, filled with
mingled curiosity and dread of the thing
which they were soon to see.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Prudence bent over her little hair-covered
trunk, lifting aside this parcel and
that until, oh, could it be true, a cunning
little wooden cradle, painted bright red,
made Prue utter a shrill cry of delight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh! oh! is it for me?” cried Prue. “Oh,
I am so sorry I was naughty!”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Prudence put the cradle into Prue’s
chubby hands, who at once held it up for
Randy to admire.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a beauty,” said Randy. “Oh, Prue,
you’d ought to be good now.”
</p>
<p>
“I will,” said Prue; then, turning to
Aunt Prudence, she said, “I guess I almost
love you now, and I won’t ever plague
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess my basket ain’t hurt much
this time; but don’t borry it again, child. I
guess the cradle will ’bout fit Tabby.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I do b’lieve it will! I’ll go and
‘medjure’ her in it,” said Prue, and away
she scampered in search of her kitty.
</p>
<p>
Left alone with her aunt, Randy hesitated
a moment, then venturing a step
nearer, she said, “I think you were very
good to give the pretty cradle to Prue just
when she’d been so naughty; but,” added
Randy, as usual anxious to shield her little
sister, “she isn’t always naughty, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
now I’m ’most sure she’ll try to please you.”
She looked up wistfully, hoping for a kindly
word for Prue whom she loved so dearly.
</p>
<p>
“Children will be children,” said Aunt
Prudence, with a grim smile. “I guess
she’s no wuss’n the average.”
</p>
<p>
“Father says you never had days of
being naughty when you were a little girl,
so I should think Prue’d seem extra naughty
to you,” said Randy, slowly moving the toe
of her shoe back and forth along the cracks
in the floor. As she glanced shyly at her
aunt, hoping for one more consoling word
in regard to Prue, she was much surprised
and relieved to see Aunt Prudence actually
smiling.
</p>
<p>
“I guess your father’s forgot about the
time I threw his hat down the well to see
if it would float.”
</p>
<p>
“Did <em>you</em> do that?” asked Randy, in
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Aunt Prudence, “and what’s
more, I did it on purpose to plague him.
He was goin’ fishin’, and I wanted to go,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
too. He said girls wus no good at fishin’
and went to the shed to get his rod and line,
whistlin’ in a way that provoked me. His
hat was on the grass near where I was
standing, and, quick as a flash, I snatched
it up and threw it down the well, thinkin’
it would delay his fishin’ trip for one while.
It didn’t, though. He went bare-headed;
and soon’s ’twas found out what I’d done,
I got punished for spoilin’ his hat. Yes,
your father remembers my good days, an’
it’s just like him to forget that I ever had
naughty ones. But, Randy,” she said
abruptly, “ye don’t ask if I brought anything
in my trunk for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I never thought of it,” said
Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Like enough,” said Aunt Prudence; “it
seems to me ye nearly always think of
somebody besides yourself, Randy. I must
say, I approve of ye. Yer father, every
time he writes me, has something ter tell
of you children; and now you jest help me
unpack my trunk, an’ I’ll show ye something that, ef
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
I ain’t mistaken, will please
ye mightily.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, I’ll help you. I’ll like to,”
said Randy, and soon the contents of the
trunk were spread upon the bed. Those
garments which could be hung up were
placed upon hooks in the closet, and other
articles were neatly folded in the bureau
drawers. One puffy-looking package remained;
this Aunt Prudence placed in
Randy’s hands, saying, “There, Randy,
there’s the material for making some
Christmas presents; and if it makes ye
happy, I’ll be glad of it.”
</p>
<p>
Very eagerly Randy untied the parcel,
and uttered a little cry of delight when
the open wrapping disclosed some beautiful
colored worsteds of various hues.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll teach ye ter knit while I’m here,”
said Aunt Prudence. “And now the evenings
are beginning to be cool, ye might
begin ter make a pretty little shawl for
yer mother out of that deep red worsted;
I guess there’s enough of it. That blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
yarn will make some mittens for little
Prudence, and the rest of it ye can do
what ye like with.”
</p>
<p>
Randy’s delight knew no bounds, and
she could hardly wait to hunt for needles
and have her first lesson in knitting.
</p>
<p>
That night, in their little chamber under
the eaves, the children talked of Aunt Prudence.
</p>
<p>
“I always said Aunt Prudence might be
nice, if we really knew her,” said Randy.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Prue, “you said that when
she was here before, I ’member it; but,
Randy,” she added, “that was when I was
a little girl.”
</p>
<p>
Randy stifled a laugh, “Why, Prue, what
are you now?” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Randy, you do know you medjured
me last Saturday, and you said I’d
growed most a inch.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, so you have,” said Randy, gently,
“and it’s likely you’ll grow a lot more this
winter.”
</p>
<p>
“Course I will,” said Prue, “and, oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
Randy, mustn’t Aunt Prudence have growed
awful fast when she was a little girl? Just
think how big she is now! She’s growed
good awful fast, too, Randy,” she continued,
“for she wouldn’t have gived me that little
cradle for anything the last time she was
here, would she, Randy?”
</p>
<p>
Randy ignored this question.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to be going to sleep, Prue,”
she said; “but I’ll tell you something first:
I mean to be just as nice to Aunt Prudence
as I can, while she stays here.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” said little Prue. “I told her
to-day when her needle plagued her, I told
her I’d fred all her needles when she was
sewing, and you’d never guess what she
said, Randy. She said I was a good little
girl,—she did, truly.”
</p>
<p>
The patter of raindrops on the roof soon
lulled the children to sleep, and in their
dreams Aunt Prudence figured as the Goddess
of Plenty, distributing gifts with lavish
hands.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—A WEDDING FEAST</h2>
<p>
Sunday morning Randy and Prue were
early at church, and as they leaned back
against the pew, in expectation of one of
Parson Spooner’s long sermons, Randy put
her hand in her pocket and lovingly caressed
a square envelope which she had placed there
before starting for church.
</p>
<p>
“Got any candy in your pocket, Randy?”
eagerly questioned Prue, as she leaned
toward her sister. Randy shook her
head.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t Jotham give you some when he
speaked to you at the door?” she asked in
such a loud whisper that Randy ejaculated
“sh-sh,” and again shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“Then what’s in your pocket?” persisted
Prue.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
Randy drew Helen’s precious letter from
her pocket, showing just enough of the
envelope to satisfy Prue’s curiosity. Then
the little girl took a hymn book from the
rack, and with her wee forefinger commenced
to point out, and at the same time
name those letters which she knew. She
found every O upon the page, then every
S, and Randy thought best to let her thus
amuse herself as, at least, she was quiet—a
most unusual thing.
</p>
<p>
Helen had mailed the letter at once
upon reaching Boston, and Mr. Weston
had brought it from the village on the following
day and placed it in Randy’s hand
as she sat listening to Mrs. Gray, who had
called to deliver Helen’s message.
</p>
<p>
“A letter for me, father?” questioned
Randy in surprise. “Why, who’s it
from?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston laughed. “Shouldn’t wonder
if ye had to open it to find out, Randy,”
said he.
</p>
<p>
Randy opened it and laughed with delight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
when she found it was from Helen. She
had read it three times and had taken it to
church with her, because she said she “just
couldn’t leave it at home.”
</p>
<p>
So Sunday morning Randy kept her
mind upon the sermon, and her hand
upon the letter. The sermon had been less
lengthy than usual, and when the good
old pastor had closed the Bible, he removed
his spectacles; and as he slowly
wiped them, he said: “Dear friends, I have
a notice to give to-day, or perhaps I should
say an invitation, and there could be no
better time or place for what I have to say.
</p>
<p>
“A quiet wedding ceremony took place
at a little church in New York City, the contracting
parties being our friend and neighbor,
Mr. Sandy McLeod,—or, as the papers
have it, Alexander McLeod,—and Miss Margaret
McLean of Scotland, an old playmate
and friend, from whom our friend has been
separated many years. I have received a
delightful letter from him in which I am
asked to make this announcement, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
say that they will be at home on Wednesday
evening. They extend an invitation
to all the good people of this town to be
present, and an especially urgent request
that all the children be there.”
</p>
<p>
What a stir that announcement made!
What a great event!
</p>
<p>
Sandy’s farm was one of the finest in
the neighborhood, and his house the largest
and most substantial in the place; but
Helen and Parson Spooner were the only
people who had ever entered it, save Sandy
himself and the men who worked for him.
</p>
<p>
Fabulous tales the men had told of the
fine things which the house contained; so
curiosity was rife regarding it, and now
every one, even the little ones of the parish,
were bidden welcome.
</p>
<p>
After church Randy stopped a moment
to speak to the Babson girls and Phœbe
Small, to tell them of the letter from Helen,
promising to read it to them if they would
call on Monday afternoon.
</p>
<p>
The girls promised, saying, “You can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
read us the letter, and then we’ll talk over
the party, or whatever it is to be, at Sandy
McLeod’s.”
</p>
<p>
Promptly, on Monday afternoon, the
girls arrived, and the letter was produced
and read. How they laughed at
Helen’s bright description of the events
of her homeward journey. Phœbe Small
felt that in receiving the letter Randy had
been especially favored. A little twinge of
jealousy caused her to part her lips to
make a sharp little speech; but, remembering
a promise to Helen, and her own
resolution, she said pleasantly, “You must
have been pleased to receive it, Randy; I’m
glad she wrote it to you.”
</p>
<p>
It was so unlike her usual remarks that
the Babson girls looked at each other; but
Randy slipped her arm around Phœbe as
they stood by the window, and Phœbe felt
rewarded.
</p>
<p>
They talked earnestly over the event of
Wednesday evening, and all were enthusiastically
expectant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
As the afternoon waned, the girls took
leave of Randy, looking back as they went
down the road to call to her, “We’ll see
you Wednesday night.”
</p>
<p>
Wednesday proved to be a lovely day,
and the evening sky was bright with
stars, the air cold and crisp when the
merry party drove up to Sandy’s door.
As no one wished to be the first to arrive,
a large party met at Mrs. Weston’s house
and together they drove to the McLeod
farm.
</p>
<p>
The large house was ablaze with lights,
and as the teams stopped, the door was
opened wide and a cheery voice shouted,
“It’s glad we are to see ye, friends, come
in, come in,” and Sandy led the way
proudly to a silver-haired little woman,
who stood waiting to greet her husband’s
friends and neighbors.
</p>
<p>
Such a sweet-faced little woman, who
had a gentle, gracious word for every
new friend, and a kiss for each one of
the children.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
When Sandy brought Prue to her,
saying, “This is the little lass, Margaret,
wha said ‘write the letter,’” she took the
child upon her lap and put her arms
about her, saying, “Bless the bairn, will
ye come sometimes to see me? it wad
gae me much pleasure.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes, I will come,” answered Prue,
“if I may bring Randy. She’s my big
sister, and there’s no one like her anywhere.”
</p>
<p>
Prue was assured that Randy would
be more than welcome. Every one was
charmed with the gentle little Scotch
woman, who seemed equally pleased with
her new friends.
</p>
<p>
They sometimes found it a bit difficult
to understand her. Sandy had been so long
in America, and had tried so earnestly to
be like his neighbors, that he expressed
himself in very good English, with here
and there a bit of his old dialect appearing.
His wife, however, had lived in a little
town some miles distant from the city, and
used many words which, while in common
use in the Scottish village, were utterly
unknown to her new friends. But her
manner could not be misunderstood. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
was unmistakably the manner of a gentle,
lovely character, bearing good-will to
all.
</p>
<div><a name='f225' id='f225'></a></div>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i010' id='i010'></a>
<img src="images/illus-225.jpg" alt="“At the Head of a Long Table stood Helen Dayton”" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“At the Head of a Long Table stood Helen Dayton”</span>
</div>
<p>
The hum of conversation rose to a din
as the young people laughed and chatted.
All had been admiring the furnishings,
which were indeed charming. There were
some quaint old chairs which had belonged
to Sandy’s father; a large family portrait
hung on the wall above the fireplace;
some beautiful old candlesticks in which
bright tapers burned; and the evident delight
of their guests charmed Sandy and
his dear old wife.
</p>
<p>
“Now, friends,” said Sandy, stepping forward,
“ye ha’ all seen my Margaret, noo
will ye walk this way and I’ll gie ye another
surprise,” and he led the way to the
end of the parlor, where he opened a door,
and there at the head of a long table, spread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
with a feast such as no one in the village
had ever seen, stood Helen Dayton.
</p>
<p>
With a sharp cry of delight Randy
ran to greet her, and was folded in Helen’s
arms. Then every one crowded about
Miss Dayton, and many were the questions
with which she was plied.
</p>
<p>
“I cannot answer all these questions,”
she said with a merry laugh; “but I’ll tell
you how I happened to be here again so
soon. I hastened home, as many of you
know, to see my Uncle Robert, who was to
be in Boston but a few days, and on the
day of his departure for the West I received
the glad news of the wedding in a most
delightful letter, which also contained a
cordial invitation for me to be present and
surprise you all to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re glad enough to see you again,”
said Jotham Potts, and a chorus of voices
echoed the boy’s frank speech.
</p>
<p>
Then the feast began. Such a treat it
was to Sandy’s neighbors and friends. The
children were fairly wild with excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
A giant wedding cake graced the centre of
the table, and the beautiful frosting, with
its garlands of flowers and little sugar
cupids, delighted the children, who thought
it the finest thing which they had ever
seen.
</p>
<p>
A huge platter of roast turkey on one
end of the table, and one of roast goose
on the other, proved very tempting; and a
chicken pie with its fluted crust was not to
be ignored.
</p>
<p>
When these were removed, Sandy filled
their places with huge fancy baskets of
fruit; and still the candles burned and
flickered, and the hum of merry voices filled
the old house with gladness. At a late
hour the happy party left, the neighbors,
one and all, wishing the dear old couple
every blessing, and promising to be as
neighborly as their busy lives would permit.
</p>
<p>
To Randy, Helen said: “I shall not run
away this time without saying good-by.
I will come to-morrow and spend a little
time with you, and then you may go with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
me to the village, where I must take the
train for home.”
</p>
<p>
Bright and early on the following day,
Randy was up, singing as she moved about
the kitchen, as usual, trying to help.
</p>
<p>
“She’s coming to-day, she’s coming to-day,”
sang Prue, as she skipped about the
room, and Randy’s heart joined gladly in
the song.
</p>
<p>
At that very moment Helen was coming
up the walk, and as she tapped lightly at
the door, Prue ran to let her in.
</p>
<p>
How bright she looked in her cloth gown
and trim jacket, her feather collar and
bewitching hat. She took off her wraps,
as Mrs. Weston suggested, and sat down
to chat with Randy.
</p>
<p>
“What is the news?” said Helen.
“What has happened during my absence,
Randy?”
</p>
<p>
“Very little has happened,” said Randy,
“only a few things. School is to open
next week; that’s a week earlier than
last year, and Mr. Lawton says he’ll keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
his best room warm enough for us if it
takes his whole woodpile.”
</p>
<p>
“And I’m going to school,” said Prue,
and she looked at Helen as if she expected
to see that young lady stunned by such an
announcement.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to study reading and rifm-tic,”
she added, hoping to produce even
more of an impression.
</p>
<p>
Helen and Randy laughed, “I hope they
will reserve ‘rifm-tic,’” said Helen, “until
a little later.”
</p>
<p>
“When there is snow,” said Randy,
“we can coast on our sled down to Mr.
Lawton’s house, without stopping; and
although I’m pretty tall this winter, I
think I shall coast just as I did last season,
only this year Prue will sit behind me.”
</p>
<p>
“And Jotham ’most always drags her
home, so she don’t have to walk ’t all,”
said Prue, anxious to tell all the particulars.
</p>
<p>
“Randy is fortunate to have such an
accommodating friend,” said Helen, “and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
now I have something to tell you. I have
been helping my aunt to make some plans
for the winter, and I have really found
three days at the Christmas holidays for
which I have made no engagements, and,
if it will please you, Randy, I will give
those days to you.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Weston paused in her work to say,
“We shall all be pleased to have you with
us, and Randy will be wild until you come.”
</p>
<p>
Helen had taken leave of Sandy and his
wife at their home, so when Randy’s father
brought the old horse and wagon to the
door, she said good-by to Mrs. Weston and
little Prue, and with Randy and her father
rode to the depot at the centre.
</p>
<p>
They arrived just a few moments before
the train was due, and Helen and Randy
walked up and down the platform, talking
earnestly over the promised visit and the
winter schooldays so soon to commence.
</p>
<p>
“I shall think of you every day,” said
Randy, “and I mean to study so hard this
winter that some day, when I write, I shall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
be able to tell you that I am at the head of
my class.”
</p>
<p>
“That is right,” said Helen; “ambition
and hard work will accomplish wonders.”
</p>
<p>
Just then the whistle sounded, and soon
the train came around the curve and stopped
at the little station.
</p>
<p>
Very gently Helen kissed Randy, saying,
“Remember I shall soon be here again.”
</p>
<p>
Then the train started, and through her
tears Randy saw Helen’s beautiful, smiling
face at the window. When the last car
was out of sight, Randy turned toward her
father a face which was a combination of
smiles and tears.
</p>
<p>
“Well, Randy,” said he, “which is it,
laughing or crying?”
</p>
<p>
“Both,” said Randy, “crying because I
am sorry to have her go, and smiling because
I know just when she will come
again. And, now, father, I am going to
tell you something. I mean to be the best
scholar in school this year. I’d like to be
able to talk and write as well as Miss Dayton does.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
I don’t suppose I could do that,
but I will come as near as I can,” and
Randy looked to her father for his approval.
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, Randy, that’s right,” said
her father, heartily, “and now, I’ll tell
<em>you</em> something. Sandy McLeod says that
if Nathan Lawton gives the use of his best
room for a schoolroom to the children, he
isn’t going to have Nathan outdo him, so
he’s offered a prize of a five-dollar gold
piece to be given to the best scholar at the
school this winter. I am glad that you
spoke your mind before you knew about
the prize. I’m willing you should try for
it, but I’m glad to know that you intended
to study before you had any idea of a prize
to be won.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll make myself a good scholar,” said
Randy, “and I’ll get the prize, too.”
Randy never forgot that morning.
</p>
<p>
Years after, the scene, in all its completeness,
would rise before her with a perfection
of detail that would for a moment startle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
her; the old mare leisurely crawling up the
road toward home; the stone walls along
the sides of the road, still covered with
blackberry vines, their foliage russet-colored
against the cold gray stones, and their
thorny stems red in the October sunshine.
</p>
<p>
Across the roads the fields were dry and
dun-colored, but in places the grass was
still green, and over all the bright blue
sky with its floating clouds. Birds twittered
in the tree-tops or flew in swirling
lines above the sunny fields, and everywhere,
although the trees were bare and
the flowers gone, a feeling of gladness and
cheer seemed present.
</p>
<p>
Randy turned to speak to her father and
found that he was looking curiously at her.
“Oh, father,” said she, “I was just thinking
that it seems as if everything was glad
for some reason this morning. I don’t
know how to tell you just how I feel, but
the sky seems so bright, the birds are singing,
and when I looked at you I thought
that you looked glad too.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, Randy, I see just what you mean.
It is bright and glad and sunny to-day, and
as to my looking glad, I think I ought to.
I’ve got your mother, and Prue, and you,
Randy, and I’ve got something more to be
thankful for—something to be thankful to
<em>you</em> for.”
</p>
<p>
“Thankful to <em>me</em>!” gasped Randy, in
amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Randy, yes. I got a letter last
night. Ye know I went down to the centre
after supper, and I didn’t get home ’til after
you and Prue was in bed. Well, I wasn’t
expecting to hear from anybody, special,
and I never opened the letter ’til I’d put
the cat out and fastened up. Then I
thought of the letter and sat down at the
table to read it. Yer mother was puttin’
the last stitches into a stockin’ she was
mendin’ when I came to a place in the
letter that made me hop. Mother came,
and looking over my shoulder read the line
I put my finger on.
</p>
<p>
“Randy, do ye remember that day last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
summer when ye listened at the roadside to
what Jason Meade was sayin’ ’bout makin’
me sell my pasture land to him? Do yer
rec’lect how ye run ’til ye was ’bout beat
out to reach me ’fore he could, and how ye
begged me not to sell?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” said Randy; then in sudden
fear, “he didn’t make you, did he, father?”
</p>
<p>
The girl’s wide open eyes looked anxiously
up into his face as she grasped his
arm and waited for an answer.
</p>
<p>
“Make me! Well, I guess not! Randy,
that letter was from the big railroad company,
and, val’ble as I thought the land
would be, they’ve offered me more’n I ever
dreamed of. I shan’t be what city folks
would call wealthy, but I’ll be ’stonishin’
well off. Your mother and I will be able
to take things a little easier; and, Randy,
you shall have all the schoolin’ ye want,
and so shall little Prue. I’d ’bout made up
my mind to let Meade have that land, he
seemed to have set his mind on it; and I
b’lieve I should have let him have it, ef you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
had gone on ter Mis’ Gray’s and stopped to
tea with Miss Dayton, as you intended.
But for you my land would have been in
Jason Meade’s hands, and I might ’a’ whistled
fer it. You gave up your pleasure to
do the right thing at the right time; as I
said that day, I’ve got a daughter to be
thankful for.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, father,” said Randy, “it seemed a
little thing to do, but I was so anxious to
reach you in time that I forgot everything
else, even Miss Dayton and the tea at Mrs.
Gray’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, ye did yer duty, Randy, even
when ye feared the men would find ye
listening and be angry. Always be brave
to do right, as ye did that time, and ye’ll
make a fine woman.”
</p>
<p>
Small wonder that Randy remembered
that morning’s ride! The bright sunlight
of her father’s commendation seemed to
outshine nature’s sunshine. The thought
that she had been instrumental in bringing
good fortune to her parents, who had toiled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
early and late, filled Randy’s heart with a
gladness which she would have found difficult
to describe.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Weston accepted the company’s offer
for his land, and with their good fortune
he and his wife seemed to have regained
a bit of their youth; and they were never
happier than when making plans for Randy
and Prue or lending a helping hand to
some friend or neighbor less fortunate
than themselves.
</p>
<p>
Randy still indulges in day-dreams which,
at present, are filled with anticipations of
schooldays so near at hand, and the winter’s
pleasures which the boys and girls
of the village are already planning; and
when next we meet Randy and Prue, it
will be in “Randy’s Winter.”

<p>
It is a great deal to say of a book that it is at the same time
fascinating and noble. This is what “Betty Seldon, Patriot” is,
and in fact no one of the many who read and admired “Beck’s
Fortune” would expect a book by Miss Thompson to be otherwise.
Betty is a bright Connecticut girl, happily as industrious and
filial as she is attractive. Her devotion to her father, a
captain in the Continental army, and her experience with a Tory
uncle, who appears upon the supposed death of her father and
takes her to his home in Pennsylvania, pretending to be her
guardian, form the basis of the book. Historical events are
accurately traced leading up to the surrender of Cornwallis at
Yorktown, with reunion and happiness for all who deserve it.
Betty is worth a thousand of the fickle coquette heroines of some
latter-day popular novels, and the historical setting of the
story is strong and effective.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
